This program is brought to you by Stanford University.  ^SJ20001

#### [0002](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=10.47,14.443)  
Please visit us at stanford.edu  ^SJ20002

#### [0003](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=22.492,30.019)  
Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement  ^SJ20003

#### [0004](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=30.02,32.738)  
from one of the finest universities in the world.  ^SJ20004

#### [0005](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=35.559,41.559)  
Truth be told I never graduated from college  ^SJ20005

#### [0006](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=41.56,45.929)  
and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.  ^SJ20006

#### [0007](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=47.98,52.009)  
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.  ^SJ20007

#### [0008](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=52.01,54.849)  
No big deal. Just three stories.  ^SJ20008

#### [0009](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=55.85,59.569)  
The first story is about connecting the dots.  ^SJ20009

#### [0010](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=61.01,63.894)  
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,  ^SJ20010

#### [0011](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=63.98,65.798)  
but then stayed around as a drop-in  ^SJ20011

#### [0012](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=65.799,68.728)  
for another 18 months or so before I really quit.  ^SJ20012

#### [0013](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=69.41,71.078)  
So why did I drop out?  ^SJ20013

#### [0014](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=72.23,74.369)  
It started before I was born.  ^SJ20014

#### [0015](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=75.25,79.034)  
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,  ^SJ20015

#### [0016](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=79.24,81.349)  
and she decided to put me up for adoption.  ^SJ20016

#### [0017](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=82.36,86.228)  
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,  ^SJ20017

#### [0018](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=86.309,88.608)  
so everything was all set for me to  ^SJ20018

#### [0019](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=88.609,91.098)  
be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.  ^SJ20019

#### [0020](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=91.74,94.149)  
Except that when I popped out they decided  ^SJ20020

#### [0021](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=94.15,97.549)  
at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.  ^SJ20021

#### [0022](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=97.92,100.049)  
So my parents, who were on a waiting list,  ^SJ20022

#### [0023](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=100.16,104.469)  
got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected  ^SJ20023

#### [0024](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=104.47,106.919)  
baby boy; do you want him?"  ^SJ20024

#### [0025](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=107.43,113.074)  
They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that  ^SJ20025

#### [0026](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=113.3,115.309)  
my mother had never graduated from college  ^SJ20026

#### [0027](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=115.31,118.469)  
and that my father had never graduated from high school.  ^SJ20027

#### [0028](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=119.16,122.449)  
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.  ^SJ20028

#### [0029](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=123.43,125.389)  
She only relented a few months later when  ^SJ20029

#### [0030](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=125.39,132.509)  
my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.  ^SJ20030

#### [0031](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=132.54,139.339)  
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college  ^SJ20031

#### [0032](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=139.34,141.659)  
that was almost as expensive as Stanford,  ^SJ20032

#### [0033](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=142.47,144.309)  
and all of my working-class parents'  ^SJ20033

#### [0034](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=144.31,146.779)  
savings were being spent on my college tuition.  ^SJ20034

#### [0035](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=147.61,150.409)  
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.  ^SJ20035

#### [0036](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=150.72,152.759)  
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life  ^SJ20036

#### [0037](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=152.76,156.379)  
and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.  ^SJ20037

#### [0038](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=156.85,160.089)  
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved  ^SJ20038

#### [0039](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=160.289,160.899)  
their entire life.  ^SJ20039

#### [0040](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=162.6,166.938)  
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.  ^SJ20040

#### [0041](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=166.939,169.398)  
It was pretty scary at the time,  ^SJ20041

#### [0042](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=169.399,172.808)  
but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.  ^SJ20042

#### [0043](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=174.08,176.689)  
The minute I dropped out I could stop  ^SJ20043

#### [0044](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=176.69,179.484)  
taking the required classes that didn't interest me,  ^SJ20044

#### [0045](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=179.74,183.599)  
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.  ^SJ20045

#### [0046](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=184.76,188.099)  
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,  ^SJ20046

#### [0047](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=188.17,190.498)  
so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,  ^SJ20047

#### [0048](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=190.59,194.179)  
I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,  ^SJ20048

#### [0049](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=194.72,197.279)  
and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday  ^SJ20049

#### [0050](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=197.28,201.079)  
night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna  ^SJ20050

#### [0051](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=201.15,203.079)  
temple. I loved it.  ^SJ20051

#### [0052](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=203.85,206.259)  
And much of what I stumbled into by following  ^SJ20052

#### [0053](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=206.26,209.689)  
my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.  ^SJ20053

#### [0054](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=209.689,214.374)  
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that  ^SJ20054

#### [0055](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=214.5,217.989)  
time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.  ^SJ20055

#### [0056](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=218.35,222.748)  
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,  ^SJ20056

#### [0057](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=222.749,225.108)  
was beautifully hand calligraphed.  ^SJ20057

#### [0058](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=225.39,228.889)  
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,  ^SJ20058

#### [0059](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=229.73,232.679)  
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.  ^SJ20059

#### [0060](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=233.1,236.094)  
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,  ^SJ20060

#### [0061](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=236.3,237.949)  
about varying the amount of space  ^SJ20061

#### [0062](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=237.95,239.664)  
between different letter combinations,  ^SJ20062

#### [0063](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=239.85,242.399)  
about what makes great typography great.  ^SJ20063

#### [0064](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=243.44,245.579)  
It was beautiful, historical,  ^SJ20064

#### [0065](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=245.8,249.179)  
artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,  ^SJ20065

#### [0066](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=249.75,251.448)  
and I found it fascinating.  ^SJ20066

#### [0067](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=252.21,256.798)  
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.  ^SJ20067

#### [0068](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=257.57,258.774)  
But ten years later,  ^SJ20068

#### [0069](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=258.87,261.629)  
when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,  ^SJ20069

#### [0070](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=261.88,265.469)  
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.  ^SJ20070

#### [0071](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=265.47,268.939)  
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.  ^SJ20071

#### [0072](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=269.49,272.769)  
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,  ^SJ20072

#### [0073](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=272.96,274.589)  
the Mac would have never had multiple  ^SJ20073

#### [0074](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=274.59,277.114)  
typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.  ^SJ20074

#### [0075](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=277.4,279.614)  
And since Windows just copied the Mac,  ^SJ20075

#### [0076](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=279.7,283.516)  
it's likely that no personal computer would have them.  ^SJ20076

#### [0077](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=287.07,291.139)  
If I had never dropped out,  ^SJ20077

#### [0078](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=291.14,294.039)  
I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,  ^SJ20078

#### [0079](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=294.11,297.149)  
and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography  ^SJ20079

#### [0080](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=297.15,300.519)  
that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect  ^SJ20080

#### [0081](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=300.52,302.449)  
the dots looking forward when I was in college.  ^SJ20081

#### [0082](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=302.45,306.649)  
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.  ^SJ20082

#### [0083](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=307.13,310.149)  
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;  ^SJ20083

#### [0084](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=310.15,312.499)  
you can only connect them looking backwards.  ^SJ20084

#### [0085](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=312.92,315.549)  
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect  ^SJ20085

#### [0086](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=315.549,316.444)  
in your future.  ^SJ20086

#### [0087](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=316.73,320.729)  
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,  ^SJ20087

#### [0088](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=320.73,321.439)  
whatever.  ^SJ20088

#### [0089](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=322.35,328.098)  
Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart  ^SJ20089

#### [0090](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=328.1,333.346)  
Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.  ^SJ20090

#### [0091](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=338.6,342.699)  
My second story is about love and loss.  ^SJ20091

#### [0092](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=344.03,347.929)  
I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.  ^SJ20092

#### [0093](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=348.31,351.519)  
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.  ^SJ20093

#### [0094](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=351.87,355.259)  
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of  ^SJ20094

#### [0095](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=355.26,359.579)  
us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.  ^SJ20095

#### [0096](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=359.66,363.349)  
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh  ^SJ20096

#### [0097](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=363.35,365.639)  
a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.  ^SJ20097

#### [0098](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=366.36,367.949)  
And then I got fired.  ^SJ20098

#### [0099](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=369.05,371.899)  
How can you get fired from a company you started?  ^SJ20099

#### [0100](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=372.4,375.899)  
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought  ^SJ20100

#### [0101](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=375.9,378.459)  
was very talented to run the company with me,  ^SJ20101

#### [0102](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=378.68,380.469)  
and for the first year or so things went well.  ^SJ20102

#### [0103](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=380.47,382.679)  
But then our visions of the future began  ^SJ20103

#### [0104](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=382.68,385.739)  
to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.  ^SJ20104

#### [0105](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=385.77,388.669)  
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.  ^SJ20105

#### [0106](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=389.15,392.729)  
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.  ^SJ20106

#### [0107](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=392.73,395.889)  
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,  ^SJ20107

#### [0108](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=395.89,397.699)  
and it was devastating.  ^SJ20108

#### [0109](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=398.53,400.639)  
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.  ^SJ20109

#### [0110](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=401.11,403.869)  
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs  ^SJ20110

#### [0111](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=403.87,407.209)  
down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.  ^SJ20111

#### [0112](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=407.21,410.489)  
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce  ^SJ20112

#### [0113](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=410.88,413.699)  
and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.  ^SJ20113

#### [0114](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=414.42,415.839)  
I was a very public failure,  ^SJ20114

#### [0115](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=415.84,418.089)  
and I even thought about running away from the valley.  ^SJ20115

#### [0116](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=418.57,423.389)  
But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.  ^SJ20116

#### [0117](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=423.59,427.799)  
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.  ^SJ20117

#### [0118](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=427.8,430.969)  
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.  ^SJ20118

#### [0119](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=432.09,433.839)  
And so I decided to start over.  ^SJ20119

#### [0120](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=434.91,437.909)  
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from  ^SJ20120

#### [0121](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=437.91,440.319)  
Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.  ^SJ20121

#### [0122](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=441.01,443.189)  
The heaviness of being successful was  ^SJ20122

#### [0123](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=443.19,446.024)  
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,  ^SJ20123

#### [0124](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=446.22,447.159)  
less sure about everything.  ^SJ20124

#### [0125](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=447.16,450.899)  
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.  ^SJ20125

#### [0126](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=451.42,454.349)  
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,  ^SJ20126

#### [0127](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=454.53,455.889)  
another company named Pixar,  ^SJ20127

#### [0128](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=455.89,459.079)  
and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.  ^SJ20128

#### [0129](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=459.78,462.609)  
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature  ^SJ20129

#### [0130](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=462.61,464.104)  
film, Toy Story,  ^SJ20130

#### [0131](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=464.38,469.979)  
and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.  ^SJ20131

#### [0132](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=469.98,473.799)  
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,  ^SJ20132

#### [0133](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=473.89,476.709)  
I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at  ^SJ20133

#### [0134](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=476.71,479.439)  
NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.  ^SJ20134

#### [0135](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=479.89,482.779)  
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.  ^SJ20135

#### [0136](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=483.88,485.749)  
I'm pretty sure none of this would  ^SJ20136

#### [0137](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=485.75,487.749)  
have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.  ^SJ20137

#### [0138](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=488.15,491.889)  
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.  ^SJ20138

#### [0139](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=492.43,497.859)  
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.  ^SJ20139

#### [0140](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=498.3,501.209)  
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved  ^SJ20140

#### [0141](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=501.21,504.304)  
what I did. You've got to find what you love.  ^SJ20141

#### [0142](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=504.54,507.469)  
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.  ^SJ20142

#### [0143](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=508.17,510.099)  
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,  ^SJ20143

#### [0144](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=510.1,512.448)  
and the only way to be truly satisfied  ^SJ20144

#### [0145](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=512.45,514.808)  
is to do what you believe is great work.  ^SJ20145

#### [0146](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=515.08,518.457)  
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  ^SJ20146

#### [0147](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=518.46,523.119)  
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.  ^SJ20147

#### [0148](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=523.74,527.509)  
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.  ^SJ20148

#### [0149](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=527.51,528.934)  
And, like any great relationship,  ^SJ20149

#### [0150](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=529.06,531.994)  
it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  ^SJ20150

#### [0151](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=532.26,536.149)  
So keep looking. Don't settle.  ^SJ20151

#### [0152](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=545.3,548.489)  
My third story is about death.  ^SJ20152

#### [0153](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=549.27,552.529)  
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:  ^SJ20153

#### [0154](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=552.53,555.754)  
"If you live each day as if it was your last,  ^SJ20154

#### [0155](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=555.91,557.969)  
someday you'll most certainly be right."  ^SJ20155

#### [0156](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=560.86,565.359)  
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,  ^SJ20156

#### [0157](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=565.52,567.139)  
I have looked in the mirror every morning  ^SJ20157

#### [0158](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=567.14,570.019)  
and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,  ^SJ20158

#### [0159](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=570.02,573.719)  
would I want to do what I am about to do today?"  ^SJ20159

#### [0160](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=574.31,577.669)  
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,  ^SJ20160

#### [0161](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=577.92,579.559)  
I know I need to change something.  ^SJ20161

#### [0162](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=580.57,583.929)  
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important  ^SJ20162

#### [0163](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=583.93,587.209)  
tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  ^SJ20163

#### [0164](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=587.92,592.714)  
Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,  ^SJ20164

#### [0165](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=592.89,594.644)  
all fear of embarrassment or failure -  ^SJ20165

#### [0166](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=594.87,597.719)  
these things just fall away in the face of death,  ^SJ20166

#### [0167](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=598.18,600.279)  
leaving only what is truly important.  ^SJ20167

#### [0168](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=600.83,603.669)  
Remembering that you are going to die is the best  ^SJ20168

#### [0169](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=603.67,607.729)  
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  ^SJ20169

#### [0170](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=608.2,612.569)  
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.  ^SJ20170

#### [0171](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=613.95,616.979)  
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.  ^SJ20171

#### [0172](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=616.98,620.164)  
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,  ^SJ20172

#### [0173](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=620.28,623.069)  
and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.  ^SJ20173

#### [0174](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=623.6,625.609)  
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.  ^SJ20174

#### [0175](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=626.27,628.539)  
The doctors told me this was almost  ^SJ20175

#### [0176](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=628.54,630.789)  
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,  ^SJ20176

#### [0177](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=630.79,635.069)  
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.  ^SJ20177

#### [0178](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=635.84,640.069)  
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,  ^SJ20178

#### [0179](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=640.32,642.909)  
which is doctor's code for prepare to die.  ^SJ20179

#### [0180](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=642.91,647.959)  
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought  ^SJ20180

#### [0181](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=647.96,651.169)  
you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.  ^SJ20181

#### [0182](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=651.85,653.749)  
It means to make sure everything is buttoned  ^SJ20182

#### [0183](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=653.75,656.709)  
up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.  ^SJ20183

#### [0184](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=656.71,659.449)  
It means to say your goodbyes.  ^SJ20184

#### [0185](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=661.46,663.579)  
I lived with that diagnosis all day.  ^SJ20185

#### [0186](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=664.13,666.334)  
Later that evening I had a biopsy,  ^SJ20186

#### [0187](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=666.59,668.634)  
where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,  ^SJ20187

#### [0188](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=668.83,671.004)  
through my stomach and into my intestines,  ^SJ20188

#### [0189](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=671.26,674.479)  
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.  ^SJ20189

#### [0190](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=674.48,678.329)  
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,  ^SJ20190

#### [0191](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=678.55,681.509)  
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope  ^SJ20191

#### [0192](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=681.74,684.499)  
the doctors started crying because it turned out to be  ^SJ20192

#### [0193](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=684.5,688.469)  
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.  ^SJ20193

#### [0194](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=689.0,693.116)  
I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.  ^SJ20194

#### [0195](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=700.8,703.304)  
This was the closest I've been to facing death,  ^SJ20195

#### [0196](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=703.56,706.439)  
and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.  ^SJ20196

#### [0197](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=706.86,708.119)  
Having lived through it,  ^SJ20197

#### [0198](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=708.62,711.249)  
I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when  ^SJ20198

#### [0199](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=711.25,715.318)  
death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:  ^SJ20199

#### [0200](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=715.419,717.869)  
No one wants to die.  ^SJ20200

#### [0201](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=718.26,722.389)  
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.  ^SJ20201

#### [0202](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=722.39,725.819)  
And yet death is the destination we all share.  ^SJ20202

#### [0203](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=726.19,730.174)  
No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,  ^SJ20203

#### [0204](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=730.37,734.489)  
because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.  ^SJ20204

#### [0205](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=735.02,736.584)  
It is Life's change agent.  ^SJ20205

#### [0206](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=736.63,739.049)  
It clears out the old to make way for the new.  ^SJ20206

#### [0207](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=739.87,744.479)  
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,  ^SJ20207

#### [0208](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=744.57,747.759)  
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.  ^SJ20208

#### [0209](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=748.53,751.008)  
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.  ^SJ20209

#### [0210](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=752.149,757.289)  
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.  ^SJ20210

#### [0211](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=758.11,760.409)  
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living  ^SJ20211

#### [0212](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=760.41,762.599)  
with the results of other people's thinking.  ^SJ20212

#### [0213](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=762.769,766.189)  
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner  ^SJ20213

#### [0214](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=766.19,768.449)  
voice. And most important,  ^SJ20214

#### [0215](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=768.64,771.279)  
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  ^SJ20215

#### [0216](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=771.58,775.349)  
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.  ^SJ20216

#### [0217](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=775.87,778.199)  
Everything else is secondary.  ^SJ20217

#### [0218](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=789.72,790.909)  
When I was young,  ^SJ20218

#### [0219](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=791.29,795.084)  
there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,  ^SJ20219

#### [0220](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=795.33,797.789)  
which was one of the bibles of my generation.  ^SJ20220

#### [0221](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=798.26,801.769)  
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here  ^SJ20221

#### [0222](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=801.77,805.479)  
in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.  ^SJ20222

#### [0223](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=805.839,807.589)  
This was in the late 1960's,  ^SJ20223

#### [0224](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=807.59,810.174)  
before personal computers and desktop publishing,  ^SJ20224

#### [0225](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=810.44,814.339)  
so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.  ^SJ20225

#### [0226](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=814.68,816.939)  
It was sort of like Google in paperback form,  ^SJ20226

#### [0227](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=816.94,821.344)  
35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,  ^SJ20227

#### [0228](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=821.57,824.549)  
overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.  ^SJ20228

#### [0229](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=825.49,827.089)  
Stewart and his team put out several  ^SJ20229

#### [0230](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=827.09,828.479)  
issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,  ^SJ20230

#### [0231](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=828.48,832.909)  
and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.  ^SJ20231

#### [0232](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=833.4,837.119)  
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.  ^SJ20232

#### [0233](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=838.72,840.429)  
On the back cover of their final issue  ^SJ20233

#### [0234](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=840.43,844.069)  
was a photograph of an early morning country road,  ^SJ20234

#### [0235](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=844.32,845.319)  
the kind you might find yourself  ^SJ20235

#### [0236](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=845.319,848.189)  
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.  ^SJ20236

#### [0237](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=848.93,853.139)  
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."  ^SJ20237

#### [0238](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=853.14,858.229)  
It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.  ^SJ20238

#### [0239](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=858.56,862.729)  
Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.  ^SJ20239

#### [0240](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=863.75,868.539)  
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.  ^SJ20240

#### [0241](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=868.68,871.608)  
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.  ^SJ20241

#### [0242](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc#t=871.731,874.853)  
Thank you all very much.  ^SJ20242
