Please visit us at stanford.edu

3
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:30,019
Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement

4
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,738
from one of the finest universities in the world.

5
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,559
Truth be told I never graduated from college

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,929
and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

7
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,009
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,849
No big deal. Just three stories.

9
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,569
The first story is about connecting the dots.

10
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,894
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months,

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,798
but then stayed around as a drop-in

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,728
for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

13
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,078
So why did I drop out?

14
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,369
It started before I was born.

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,034
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student,

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,349
and she decided to put me up for adoption.

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,228
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,

18
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,608
so everything was all set for me to

19
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,098
be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,149
Except that when I popped out they decided

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,549
at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,049
So my parents, who were on a waiting list,

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,469
got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected

24
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,919
baby boy; do you want him?"

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,074
They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,309
my mother had never graduated from college

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,469
and that my father had never graduated from high school.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,449
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

29
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,389
She only relented a few months later when

30
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,509
my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,339
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,659
that was almost as expensive as Stanford,

33
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,309
and all of my working-class parents'

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,779
savings were being spent on my college tuition.

35
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,409
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,759
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,379
and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,089
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved

39
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:40,899
their entire life.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,938
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.

41
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,398
It was pretty scary at the time,

42
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,808
but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,689
The minute I dropped out I could stop

44
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,484
taking the required classes that didn't interest me,

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,599
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

46
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,099
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room,

47
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,498
so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms,

48
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,179
I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with,

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,279
and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,079
night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna

51
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,079
temple. I loved it.

52
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,259
And much of what I stumbled into by following

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,689
my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

54
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:34,374
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,989
time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.

56
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,748
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer,

57
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:45,108
was beautifully hand calligraphed.

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,889
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,

59
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,679
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

60
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,094
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces,

61
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,949
about varying the amount of space

62
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,664
between different letter combinations,

63
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,399
about what makes great typography great.

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,579
It was beautiful, historical,

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,179
artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,

66
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,448
and I found it fascinating.

67
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,798
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.

68
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,774
But ten years later,

69
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,629
when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,

70
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,469
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.

71
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,939
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

72
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,769
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,589
the Mac would have never had multiple

74
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,114
typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,614
And since Windows just copied the Mac,

76
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,516
it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

77
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,139
If I had never dropped out,

78
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,039
I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,

79
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,149
and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography

80
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,519
that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,449
the dots looking forward when I was in college.

82
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,649
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

83
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,149
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;

84
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,499
you can only connect them looking backwards.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,549
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect

86
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,444
in your future.

87
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,729
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma,

88
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,439
whatever.

89
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,098
Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,346
Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.

91
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,699
My second story is about love and loss.

92
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,929
I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.

93
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,519
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.

94
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,259
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of

95
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,579
us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.

96
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,349
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh

97
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,639
a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,949
And then I got fired.

99
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,899
How can you get fired from a company you started?

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,899
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought

101
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,459
was very talented to run the company with me,

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,469
and for the first year or so things went well.

103
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,679
But then our visions of the future began

104
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,739
to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

105
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,669
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.

106
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,729
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.

107
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,889
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,

108
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,699
and it was devastating.

109
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,639
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.

110
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,869
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs

111
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,209
down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

112
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,489
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,699
and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,839
I was a very public failure,

115
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,089
and I even thought about running away from the valley.

116
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,389
But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.

117
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,799
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,969
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.

119
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,839
And so I decided to start over.

120
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,909
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from

121
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,319
Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

122
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,189
The heaviness of being successful was

123
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,024
replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again,

124
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,159
less sure about everything.

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,899
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

126
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,349
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT,

127
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,889
another company named Pixar,

128
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,079
and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

129
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,609
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature

130
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,104
film, Toy Story,

131
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,979
and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

132
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,799
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT,

133
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,709
I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at

134
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,439
NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.

135
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,779
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,749
I'm pretty sure none of this would

137
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,749
have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

138
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,889
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

139
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,859
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

140
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,209
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved

141
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,304
what I did. You've got to find what you love.

142
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,469
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

143
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,099
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life,

144
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,448
and the only way to be truly satisfied

145
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,808
is to do what you believe is great work.

146
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,457
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

147
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,119
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.

148
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,509
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

149
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,934
And, like any great relationship,

150
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,994
it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

151
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,149
So keep looking. Don't settle.

152
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,489
My third story is about death.

153
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,529
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:

154
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,754
"If you live each day as if it was your last,

155
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,969
someday you'll most certainly be right."

156
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,359
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years,

157
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,139
I have looked in the mirror every morning

158
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,019
and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life,

159
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,719
would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

160
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,669
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row,

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,559
I know I need to change something.

162
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,929
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important

163
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,209
tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,714
Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride,

165
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,644
all fear of embarrassment or failure -

166
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,719
these things just fall away in the face of death,

167
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,279
leaving only what is truly important.

168
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,669
Remembering that you are going to die is the best

169
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,729
way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

170
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,569
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

171
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,979
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

172
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,164
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,

173
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,069
and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,609
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

175
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,539
The doctors told me this was almost

176
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,789
certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,

177
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,069
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,069
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,

179
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,909
which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

180
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,959
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,169
you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.

182
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,749
It means to make sure everything is buttoned

183
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,709
up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.

184
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,449
It means to say your goodbyes.

185
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,579
I lived with that diagnosis all day.

186
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,334
Later that evening I had a biopsy,

187
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,634
where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,

188
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,004
through my stomach and into my intestines,

189
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,479
put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

190
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,329
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there,

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,509
told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope

192
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,499
the doctors started crying because it turned out to be

193
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,469
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,116
I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

195
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,304
This was the closest I've been to facing death,

196
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,439
and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.

197
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,119
Having lived through it,

198
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,249
I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when

199
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,318
death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

200
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,869
No one wants to die.

201
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,389
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

202
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,819
And yet death is the destination we all share.

203
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,174
No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,

204
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,489
because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.

205
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,584
It is Life's change agent.

206
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,049
It clears out the old to make way for the new.

207
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,479
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,

208
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,759
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.

209
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,008
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

210
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,289
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

211
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,409
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living

212
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,599
with the results of other people's thinking.

213
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,189
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner

214
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,449
voice. And most important,

215
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,279
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

216
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,349
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

217
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,199
Everything else is secondary.

218
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,909
When I was young,

219
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,084
there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog,

220
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,789
which was one of the bibles of my generation.

221
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,769
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here

222
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,479
in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

223
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,589
This was in the late 1960's,

224
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,174
before personal computers and desktop publishing,

225
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,339
so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.

226
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,939
It was sort of like Google in paperback form,

227
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,344
35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,

228
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,549
overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.

229
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,089
Stewart and his team put out several

230
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,479
issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,

231
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,909
and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.

232
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,119
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

233
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,429
On the back cover of their final issue

234
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,069
was a photograph of an early morning country road,

235
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,319
the kind you might find yourself

236
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,189
hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

237
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,139
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."

238
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,229
It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.

239
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,729
Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.

240
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,539
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

241
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,608
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

242
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,853
Thank you all very much.
