00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,369
This program is brought to you by Stanford University.

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:32,738
Please visit us at stanford.edu Thank You. I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.

3
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:45,929
Truth be told I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

4
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,009
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it.

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,849
No big deal. Just three stories.

6
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,569
The first story is about connecting the dots.

7
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:08,728
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.

8
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,078
So why did I drop out?

9
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,369
It started before I was born.

10
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,349
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:31,098
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

12
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,549
Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:58,469
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.

14
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,449
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

15
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:12,509
She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.

16
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:26,779
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

17
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,409
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.

18
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,379
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

19
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,899
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,938
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.

21
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,808
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:03,599
The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

23
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:23,079
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.

24
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,689
And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

25
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:37,989
Let me give you one example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.

26
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,108
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.

27
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:52,679
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

28
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:02,399
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.

29
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,448
It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.

30
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,798
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.

31
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:25,469
But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac.

32
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,939
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

33
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,114
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

34
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,516
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

35
00:04:47,070 --> 00:05:02,449
If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.

36
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,649
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

37
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,499
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.

38
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,444
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

39
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,439
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.

40
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:33,346
Beleiveing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart Even when it leads you off the well worn path, and that will make all the difference.

41
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,699
My second story is about love and loss.

42
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,929
I was lucky I found what I loved to do early in life.

43
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,519
Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.

44
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:59,579
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.

45
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,639
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.

46
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,949
And then I got fired.

47
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,899
How can you get fired from a company you started?

48
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,469
Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well.

49
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,739
But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.

50
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,669
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.

51
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,729
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.

52
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,699
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

53
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,639
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.

54
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,209
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

55
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:53,699
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

56
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,089
I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.

57
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,389
But something slowly began to dawn on me I still loved what I did.

58
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,799
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.

59
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,969
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.

60
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,839
And so I decided to start over.

61
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,319
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

62
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,159
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

63
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,899
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

64
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:39,079
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.

65
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:49,979
Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

66
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:59,439
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.

67
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,779
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

68
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,749
I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.

69
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,889
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

70
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,859
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

71
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,304
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love.

72
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,469
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

73
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:34,808
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

74
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,457
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

75
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,119
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle.

76
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,509
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

77
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,994
And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

78
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,149
So keep looking. Don't settle.

79
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,489
My third story is about death.

80
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:39,559
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

81
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:47,209
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

82
00:09:47,920 --> 00:10:00,279
Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

83
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,729
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

84
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,569
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

85
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,979
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.

86
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,069
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.

87
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,609
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

88
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:35,069
The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.

89
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,909
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.

90
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:51,169
It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.

91
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,709
It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.

92
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,449
It means to say your goodbyes.

93
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,579
I lived with that diagnosis all day.

94
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:14,479
Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.

95
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:28,469
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.

96
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,116
I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now.

97
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,439
This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades.

98
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:57,869
Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.

99
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,389
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.

100
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,819
And yet death is the destination we all share.

101
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:14,489
No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.

102
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,584
It is Life's change agent.

103
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,049
It clears out the old to make way for the new.

104
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:27,759
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.

105
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,008
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

106
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:37,289
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.

107
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,599
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

108
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:51,279
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

109
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,349
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

110
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,199
Everything else is secondary.

111
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:17,789
When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation.

112
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:25,479
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

113
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:34,339
This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.

114
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:44,549
It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools, and great notions.

115
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,909
Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.

116
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,119
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

117
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:08,189
On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.

118
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:18,229
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry.

119
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,729
Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself.

120
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,539
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

121
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,608
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

122
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,853
Thank you all very much.
