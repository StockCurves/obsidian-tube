1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:07,645
If you're a basketball fan, you know your team's big stars, head coach, maybe even the rookie bench warmers.

2
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:13,624
But you probably know very little about the Ph.D. mathematicians like this woman.

3
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:16,212
Her job is to crunch the numbers of the game.

4
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:20,117
We're all in sort of an arm's race to acquire information.

5
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:24,223
And she's turning basketball into a hard, cold science.

6
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:28,390
My name is Ivana Seric and I'm a data scientist.

7
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:46,459
For many years, Philly was a tough place to be a basketball fan.

8
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:54,578
But having reached the top eight in the playoffs for a second season in a row, the 76ers right now are in a renaissance.

9
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:57,918
Embiid fakes, Embiid down the lane.

10
00:00:57,918 --> 00:01:04,264
Just across the river is where the team's been hard at work and it's where I went to go meet Ivana in April.

11
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:12,050
This 125,000 square foot facility comes with all the features you'd expect from an NBA training complex.

12
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,540
It also features the office of people like Ivana who support the team behind the scenes.

13
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,380
My job involves analyzing the data that we have from NBA games.

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,597
My focus is mostly on the coaching strategy.

15
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:26,995
Coaches have a lot of intuition.

16
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:35,713
They know the game, they know the players, but we try to complete their picture of the players with data, which is hopefully unbiased.

17
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:39,392
Ivana is part of the Sixers 10-person analytics team.

18
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:45,063
The work of these statisticians has already forced a profound change in the game of basketball.

19
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,077
Teams are taking more three point shots.

20
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:48,934
Embiid for three.

21
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:56,698
Even though we make them at lower percentage than the shots closer to the basket, but they're worth more points and the trade off actually pays off.

22
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:59,039
Take a look at this clip from the '80's.

23
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,233
See how all the players are bunched up right by the hoop?

24
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,934
Compare that with today.

25
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:08,456
More and more of the action is taking place at the three point line.

26
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:13,249
Of course, it's not just basketball that's been reshaped by analytics.

27
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:23,534
Businesses of all kinds are tracking a ton of information they never tracked before thanks to new sensors, improvements in computing power, implementing cost and data storage.

28
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:30,338
Data scientists are the people making sense of that information with a combination of statistics and computer programming.

29
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:37,674
The profession's expanded rapidly in recent years and comes with an average salary of $130,000 a year.

30
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:45,240
Much of the data Ivana works with comes from technology the NBA adopted in 2013.

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:53,632
Every NBA arena has cameras that record the games and then from those cameras, they can extract player locations on a court.

32
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:59,955
These cameras record 25 frames per second, so for each basketball game, there's a million of throes of data.

33
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:04,635
And that allows Ivana to analyze plays that were previously difficult to track.

34
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,976
For example, take the pick and roll.

35
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:09,954
It's one of the most important plays in basketball.

36
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:15,703
It involves one player setting up a human shield to help a teammate shake off an opponent.

37
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:29,771
So we can look at each player, how much they run pick and rolls and how good they are at that and then we can select a player and see how often he's going to pass out of the pick and roll, how often he's going to shoot.

38
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,619
And how would that help you develop a strategy for the coaches?

39
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:37,951
So we could, for example this player, he's going to pass pretty frequently.

40
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:43,926
We can say this to the coaches and they're going to decide on the defensive strategy for the player.

41
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:51,375
But this makes Ivana's job look simpler than it actually is because she spends a lot of her time coding to extract the information she needs.

42
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:55,515
And I tried really hard to get her to talk about what exactly she looks for.

43
00:03:55,515 --> 00:04:01,356
And there's some stuff that you do that's beyond just these interfaces that you showed me today, right?

44
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:02,189
Yep.

45
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,089
Can you tell me more about that?

46
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,506
Um, not really.

47
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,634
So that's like a trade secret?

48
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:08,613
Yes.

49
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:13,384
NBA's a very competitive league, so whatever can give us that advantage, we try to keep it.

50
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:22,678
When advising the coaches with her analysis, Ivana has a decided advantage over many of her peers.

51
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:27,324
I started playing when I was seven years old and I just loved it from the first day.

52
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:31,340
I think 'cause the game is so dynamic and there's so many different skills.

53
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,412
It's what I wanted to do since I was seven years old, really.

54
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:36,291
I wanted to be a professional basketball player.

55
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,540
Yeah.

56
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:44,109
At 19, Ivana moved from her home in Croatia to New Jersey to go to college on a basketball scholarship.

57
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:49,758
And while she was a star player on her Division I team, she was also an exceptional math student.

58
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:54,585
Much of her life has been like that, balancing her love of basketball with her love of math.

59
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,578
I always thought I'm going to have to choose between the two.

60
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:05,004
I went to graduate school and that's when I really thought that, okay, I'm really choosing one or the other this time.

61
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:09,304
So I thought I really chose just math.

62
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:12,377
The plan was to become a researcher or a professor.

63
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:25,217
Then, three years into pursuing her Ph.D. in math, she heard that NBA teams were starting to hire data scientists, but only 26% of data scientists are women and Ivana didn't like her odds.

64
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:29,222
When I saw the job posting, I didn't think I would actually get the job.

65
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:38,492
I thought because being a woman in such a male dominated field, they would never really consider me or give me a fair shot.

66
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,607
But this prediction turned out to be wrong.

67
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,837
She's got both the technical and basketball backgrounds, which is sort of the ideal mix.

68
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:57,788
Her ability to capture these complex insights and then share them with players or coaches, with executives in a way that makes sense to us is super valuable and frankly, not that common.

69
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:01,625
The next evening, I attended my very first NBA game.

70
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:12,221
It was the last game of the regular season before the playoffs and my chance to catch up with the ultimate beneficiary of Ivana's work, the Sixers head coach, Brett Brown.

71
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,606
The team has had a great season so far.

72
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:18,387
What role do you think analytics has played in that success?

73
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:22,809
I think it's played a significant role in our success and many, many others.

74
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:33,302
The NBA playoffs are going to start in three or four days and immediately, we'll get an analytical assessment on the strengths or weaknesses of an opponent.

75
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:37,826
You can assess play calls, good or bad ones, ones you should do more, ones you should avoid.

76
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:46,872
Really, I think it's going to continue to grow and play a significant role in the design of organizations and coaching staff's beliefs.

77
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:53,150
That night, even though none of the starting players played in the game, the Sixers ended up crushing the Bulls.

78
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:01,296
A month later, the Sixers ended up advancing to the conference semi-finals and suffered a tough defeat at the hands of the Toronto Raptors.

79
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,019
Is this the tie breaker?

80
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:12,974
Ivana and her colleagues will keep looking for ways to help their team do better in the seasons ahead.

81
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:18,228
But the Sixers victories on the court won't be the only way she's measuring her success.

82
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:42,372
It's really exciting to be able to show young girls that they can actually have careers, but it also feels like a big responsibility because if I don't do well, it's going to seem like a woman cannot do this job, because there are not so many of us.

83
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:52,934
It's a big part of what motivates me every day to be able to show young girls that they can succeed in STEM fields and in sports.
