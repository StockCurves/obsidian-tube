1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
the stress primarily comes from not

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,819
taking action over something that you

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,080
can have some control over so if I find

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
that some particular thing is causing me

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,070
to have stress that's a a warning flag

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,990
for me what it means is there's

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,390
something that I haven't completely

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,420
identified perhaps in my conscious mind

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,390
that is bothering me and I haven't yet

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,849
taken any action on it I find as soon as

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,040
I identify it and make the first phone

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,989
call or send off the first email message

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,149
or whatever it is that we're gonna do to

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,640
start to address that situation even if

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,950
it's not solved the mere fact that we're

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,260
addressing it dramatically reduces any

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,270
stress that might come from it so stress

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,420
comes from ignoring things that you

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,059
shouldn't be ignoring I think in large

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,789
part so it's Jeff's doesn't come people

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,170
get stress wrong all the time my opinion

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,809
stress doesn't come from hard work for

23
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,949
example you know you can be working

24
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,049
incredibly hard and loving it and

25
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,439
likewise you can be out of work and

26
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:09,930
incredibly stressed over that so and

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,880
likewise if you kind of use the you know

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,590
use that as an analogy for what I was

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,420
just talking about if you're out of work

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,729
but you're going through you know a

31
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,189
disciplined approach of you know a

32
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,560
series of job interviews and so on and

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
working to remedy that situation you're

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
going to be a lot less stressed than if

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,530
you're just worrying about it and doing

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,979
nothing
