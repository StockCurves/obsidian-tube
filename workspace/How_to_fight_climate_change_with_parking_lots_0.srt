00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,919
This is a satellite image

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,838
of the Mojave Desert in the US.

4
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,507
It's a fragile desert ecosystem...

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,719
dotted with wildflower fields 
and Joshua trees

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,345
which are iconic in this region.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,472
But over the past several years

8
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,599
the landscape has started 
to change.

9
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,811
If you take a closer look in certain areas

10
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,814
you start to see more and more 
of these patches of blue.

11
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,983
They’re are solar farms.

12
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,569
And in this part of the US

13
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,572
many environmental activists 
and local residents

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,073
are not happy about them.

15
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,493
“Joshua trees are torn down to 
make way for solar projects.”

16
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,911
“... causing quite an uproar...”

17
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,039
“...piles and piles of Joshua trees.”

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,582
It isn't just the trees.

19
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,834
Solar farms in rural areas can take up 

20
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,838
valuable agricultural land and 
disrupt diverse ecosystems.

21
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,632
But transitioning to more solar power

22
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,760
and a more sustainable future 
for the US

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,261
requires a lot of land.

24
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:58,516
So, what if we could find some of that land 
inside our cities?

[Urgent piano music]

00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,524
This video is presented 
by Delta Airlines.

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,362
In 2021, President Biden announced 
ambitious plans for the US

28
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,990
to achieve net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,743
economy-wide by no later than 2050.

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,120
Solar is a critical part of the plan.

31
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,164
And over the past several years

32
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,042
as the US has ramped up 
solar power generation...

33
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,503
the vast majority of solar arrays

34
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,546
have been built in rural areas. 

35
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,798
According to one study

36
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,342
over half of utility scale 
solar facilities

37
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,718
were placed in deserts.

38
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,970
Another third in croplands.

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,181
10% in grasslands and forests.

40
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,934
And just 2.5% in urban areas.

41
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,393
That makes sense.

42
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,938
Putting solar on undeveloped 
open spaces is often

43
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,315
is often the cheapest and 
fastest way to do it.

44
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,568
But there are some major problems 
with this path.

45
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,779
Large scale installations

46
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,406
often mean bulldozing 
massive amounts of land...

47
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,993
altering plant and animal growth 
and migration patterns.

48
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,164
Or locals don't want a solar farm 
to ruin natural views.

49
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,458
Or they want to preserve farmland.

50
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,460
When you start to go bigger and bigger...

51
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,963
then it starts to become 
less comfortable for people.

52
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,464
That's Joshua Pearce.

53
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,717
He's been a photovoltaics researcher 
for two decades

54
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,804
and is a professor at the University 
of Western Ontario.

55
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,558
And so we've seen progressively 
more and more resistance

56
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,309
in the middle of the US...

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,936
to large scale solar development.

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,647
That resistance has sometimes 
been funded

59
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,023
by fossil fuel companies...

60
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,860
but people also have 
legitimate concerns.

61
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,611
And across the country

62
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,115
from Massachusetts to Ohio 
to California...

63
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,243
solar expansion has been stalled 
by protests.

64
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,205
One option that we're starting 
to see more of is agrovoltaics.

65
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,207
It's a way to build solar arrays

66
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,210
that allow for agricultural use 
between the panels...

67
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,339
to preserve some farmland for crops,
grazing, or native species.

68
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,883
But because the need for energy

69
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,926
is mostly outside of rural areas...

70
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:01,639
any kind of rural solar still means building 
long distance transmission lines

71
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,516
that can be expensive 
and an eyesore.

72
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,019
One thing that can help address
some of these issues

73
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,107
would be a kind of large, open, 
unused space closer to cities.

74
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,193
Enter: Parking lots.

75
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,905
The US has a lot of them...

76
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,325
thanks to decades of designing cities 
around cars.

77
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,995
Parking lots cover over 5% 
of developed land.

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,955
These spaces could play one part

79
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,124
in helping to fix solar’s land problem...

80
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,419
if we covered the lots in canopies 
of solar panels.

81
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,297
There is an awful lot of 
parking lot space

82
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,090
in the United States that we can 
take advantage of

83
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,384
that's already essentially unused.

84
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,637
It’s wasted space except for 
parking underneath it.

85
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,388
And it's not even used 
most of the time.

86
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,682
It's an idea that other 
parts of the world

87
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,309
like France, are embracing.

88
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,312
A 2023 policy in France will require that

89
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,981
outdoor car parks with 
more than 80 spaces...

90
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,360
cover at least half the surface area 
with solar canopies.

91
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,570
And officials estimate it could add

92
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,490
ten nuclear power plants’ worth 
of solar panels.

93
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,618
Importantly, policy like this utilizes space

94
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,955
that's already cleared land 
with little biodiversity...

95
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,415
which is also close to consumers.

96
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,585
And parking lot solar canopies 
could also provide shade

97
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,463
to cars in hot weather and 
cover from snow.

98
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,968
So why don't we see more parking lot canopies 
in the US, too? 

99
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,513
Like canopies that could cover 
Disney World parking lots.

100
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,641
Instead of the solar farms they built 
on nearby land 

101
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,893
that used to be orchards 
and forests.

102
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,605
Or covering some of LA's 
many parking lots

103
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,649
instead of overbuilding in the desert.

104
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,653
Well, the biggest obstacle to putting solar 
on parking lots

105
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,821
is... cost.

106
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,617
The cost of putting in a solar canopy 
is going to be 50%

107
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,870
to even 100% more than 
a conventional solar farm.

108
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,707
The thing that makes canopies 
more expensive

109
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,293
than a conventional solar farm is 
they're higher up off the ground.

110
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,628
And so you need more structural material

111
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,338
and you also need more 
weight at the bottom

112
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,798
holding them from blowing away.

113
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,466
And so why would a company

114
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,386
want to invest even more money 
to put in a canopy?

115
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,264
They're actually is an answer 
to that question.

116
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,309
In 2017, Pierce coauthored

117
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,438
a study looking into the economic 
potential of parking lot canopies

118
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,482
and used Walmart Supercenters 
as a case study.

119
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,278
The study found that in places 
with high solar flux

120
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,572
or more solar radiation 
in the area...

121
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,700
solar canopies could be 
incredibly profitable.

122
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,702
Like here in Phoenix, Arizona.

123
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,122
But they also found that 
even in areas in the US

124
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,584
considered to have less solar flux, 
like here in Michigan...

125
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,545
selling solar back to the grid 
at going rates...

126
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,297
could still be profitable enough

127
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,716
to make solar canopies worth it 
in the long run.

128
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,052
It really goes down to...

129
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,970
how much are you paying 
for electricity...

130
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,056
and how much solar flux do you have?

131
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,433
And most of the US, barring 
Northern Alaska

132
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,393
actually has fairly good solar fluxes.

133
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,979
I grew up in western Pennsylvania

134
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,855
which has some of the worst

135
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,982
and systems are still 
economic there.

136
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,152
In another 2021 study, 
Pearce and his team

137
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,989
found the total capacity across all US
Wal-Mart Supercenters

138
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,326
would be 11.1 gigawatts 
of solar power.

139
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,036
That's around the high estimate

140
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,747
of what the French parking lot program 
expects to make.

141
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,915
With that power...

142
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:18,294
Wal-Mart could power about 
100 electric vehicle charging stations

143
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,962
at each Wal-Mart location...

144
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,257
or if they combine the canopies 
with rooftop solar

145
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,927
there would likely be more than enough 
to power the stores.

146
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,388
It would also create the opportunity 
to sell power

147
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,807
back to utility companies 
on the main grid...

148
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,892
or stores could be the anchor

149
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,186
for a local microgrid
in the community

150
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,980
offering power to homes 
in the case of outages.

151
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,027
This isn't a one size fits all solution...

152
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:47,865
but in good locations where companies 
can afford the upfront cost of installation.

153
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,702
Pearce’s research shows canopy's 
could be a worthwhile investment.

154
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,373
It's guaranteed under warranty 
to generally work for 25 years.

155
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,165
That's an investment.

156
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,875
You're investing in capital asset

157
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,128
and it’s providing you a return 
over its lifetime.

158
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,380
You should treat it the same way you would 
any other investment.

159
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,050
Only this one is actually good for the planet
at the same time. 

160
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,386
In some parts of the US

161
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,556
institutions like airports and universities

162
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,850
are already trying solar parking lots.

163
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,059
Walmart and Target

164
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,728
are just beginning to try them out 
in certain stores

165
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,148
and policy is slowly catching up too...

166
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,900
to make these kinds of solar projects easier...

167
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,112
like Maryland offering grants for solar canopies...

168
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,448
and a New York City zoning proposal...

169
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,158
that would allow for solar on

170
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,952
more than 8500 acres 
of parking lots.

171
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,205
Parking lots can't fix solar’s

172
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,166
land scarcity problem 
on their own.

173
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,419
The amount of solar production we need 
will likely require

174
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,464
a combination of efforts, 
including in rural areas...

175
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,632
utility-scale arrays

176
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,342
canopies where we can put them 

177
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,594
arrays on rooftops...

178
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,180
and in other places like along highways

179
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,640
over landfills or
on degraded lands.

180
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,144
But solar canopies are part of 
a large toolbox...

181
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,314
that could put a huge dent in our reliance 
on fossil fuels...

182
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,525
and point to a future where more cities...

183
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,903
are finding ways to give new life...

184
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,323
to some of America's most overlooked spaces.

185
03:21:44,175 --> 03:21:45,343
I love that feeling when

186
03:21:45,343 --> 03:21:47,178
it's the beginning of fall and it's

187
03:21:47,178 --> 03:21:49,889
55 degrees outside, and it's finally
cold enough to wear my favorite winter

188
03:21:49,889 --> 03:21:51,766
sweater and jacket and beanie and gloves.

189
03:21:51,766 --> 03:21:54,685
And I drink pumpkin spice lattes to stay warm.

190
03:21:54,685 --> 03:21:56,646
But I also love the feeling when it's the middle of winter

191
03:21:56,646 --> 03:21:58,564
and out of nowhere it's 55 degrees.

192
03:21:58,564 --> 03:21:59,899
So I leave my parka home

193
03:21:59,899 --> 03:22:01,567
and go outside in my shorts and t shirt

194
03:22:01,567 --> 03:22:03,111
and i feel the warmth of the sun on my skin.

195
03:22:03,111 --> 03:22:05,988
And I consider going to the beach to tan
because it's so warm.

196
03:22:06,781 --> 03:22:07,740
The temperature is the same,

197
03:22:07,740 --> 03:22:10,118
but my reaction to it is vastly different.

198
03:22:10,368 --> 03:22:13,204
Part of the reason why is that there's more of a substance

199
03:22:13,204 --> 03:22:15,915
in my body in January as compared to September.

200
03:22:15,957 --> 03:22:17,625
It's the same substance that allows kids

201
03:22:17,625 --> 03:22:22,338
and teens to handle the cold weather better than adults.

202
03:22:25,591 --> 03:22:27,009
When you're hot, you sweat.

203
03:22:27,009 --> 03:22:28,553
When you're cold, you shiver.

204
03:22:28,553 --> 03:22:30,012
But just before you start to shiver,

205
03:22:30,012 --> 03:22:31,973
your body actually does something else.

206
03:22:31,973 --> 03:22:35,226
It starts to burn fat, not the fat we usually think of.

207
03:22:35,393 --> 03:22:38,479
There are two categories of fat that we like to think about.

208
03:22:38,479 --> 03:22:39,647
There's the white fat.

209
03:22:39,647 --> 03:22:42,942
White fat is the one that we tend to just think of as fat.

210
03:22:43,526 --> 03:22:45,528
It's called white because it looks white.

211
03:22:45,528 --> 03:22:47,238
White fat exists all throughout the body,

212
03:22:47,238 --> 03:22:48,990
cushioning our bones and organs.

213
03:22:48,990 --> 03:22:49,907
That's Dr.

214
03:22:49,907 --> 03:22:51,909
Aaron Cypess, by the way.

215
03:22:51,909 --> 03:22:53,494
White fat cells have many functions,

216
03:22:53,494 --> 03:22:54,787
one of the most important being that

217
03:22:54,787 --> 03:22:56,789
they're the body's primary energy source.

218
03:22:57,081 --> 03:23:00,751
Every single day we are using the fuel

219
03:23:00,751 --> 03:23:03,337
that's inside the white fat cells.

220
03:23:03,379 --> 03:23:04,547
But there's another type of fat

221
03:23:04,547 --> 03:23:07,842
that has a totally different function, brown fat.

222
03:23:08,050 --> 03:23:09,594
These cells are much smaller

223
03:23:09,594 --> 03:23:12,138
and because of that, resemble muscle more than fat.

224
03:23:12,346 --> 03:23:13,556
Instead of one large

225
03:23:13,556 --> 03:23:16,392
lipid droplet in a white fat cell, the brown fat

226
03:23:16,392 --> 03:23:20,438
cell, is one tightly packed bag of mitochondria.

227
03:23:20,479 --> 03:23:22,648
This is what gives it its brown appearance.

228
03:23:22,773 --> 03:23:25,318
And if you remember anything from high school biology class,

229
03:23:25,443 --> 03:23:28,571
you know that the mitochondria
are the powerhouse of the cell.

230
03:23:30,281 --> 03:23:33,784
Brown fat, instead of serving as an energy
reserve for organs

231
03:23:33,784 --> 03:23:34,994
throughout the body to burn,

232
03:23:34,994 --> 03:23:37,663
uses its power to burn energy on its own.

233
03:23:37,955 --> 03:23:38,956
And unlike white fat,

234
03:23:38,956 --> 03:23:42,293
it's only located in a few tactically positioned areas.

235
03:23:42,335 --> 03:23:45,588
It is in the neck, the shoulders, in the upper arms.

236
03:23:45,588 --> 03:23:48,174
It's down the spine and then some places within the belly.

237
03:23:48,341 --> 03:23:50,384
Lots of overlap with major blood vessels

238
03:23:50,384 --> 03:23:53,554
because warming the blood effectively warms the whole body.

239
03:23:53,554 --> 03:23:56,515
The brown fat around the neck vessels heats up, the blood

240
03:23:56,682 --> 03:23:57,975
goes to the brain, That's good.

241
03:23:57,975 --> 03:24:00,394
The brown fat depots in the shoulders, that blood,

242
03:24:00,394 --> 03:24:01,729
once it's been heated by the brown

243
03:24:01,729 --> 03:24:04,607
fat, goes right very quickly into the heart

244
03:24:04,607 --> 03:24:06,859
and then can get pumped to the rest of the body.

245
03:24:06,901 --> 03:24:09,278
And that's the first line of defense against the cold.

246
03:24:09,695 --> 03:24:12,240
If it's not enough to raise the body
temperature sufficiently,

247
03:24:12,490 --> 03:24:14,575
then the body shivers.

248
03:24:14,575 --> 03:24:16,786
But one of the craziest things that I learned
while researching

249
03:24:16,786 --> 03:24:19,622
this story is that babies can't shiver.

250
03:24:20,081 --> 03:24:21,666
When babies are born,

251
03:24:21,666 --> 03:24:24,585
they do not have the muscle mass, and really,

252
03:24:24,669 --> 03:24:26,379
perhaps not even so much of the coordination

253
03:24:26,379 --> 03:24:28,923
with the brain and the muscle to shiver effectively.

254
03:24:29,173 --> 03:24:31,759
So they need other ways of generating heat

255
03:24:31,759 --> 03:24:33,219
and brown fat is part of that.

256
03:24:33,219 --> 03:24:35,513
Babies are born with a lot of brown fat.

257
03:24:35,888 --> 03:24:37,390
According to the Cleveland Clinic,

258
03:24:37,390 --> 03:24:39,141
about 2 to 5% of a baby's

259
03:24:39,141 --> 03:24:41,143
body weight is made up of this stuff.

260
03:24:41,143 --> 03:24:43,187
It's necessary for our survival.

261
03:24:43,479 --> 03:24:44,689
The peak age for brown fat

262
03:24:44,689 --> 03:24:47,483
actually seems to be in the teen years, which explains

263
03:24:47,483 --> 03:24:48,859
why a lot of the guys in my high school

264
03:24:48,859 --> 03:24:50,528
wore shorts in the winter.

265
03:24:50,528 --> 03:24:52,780
But as we get older, our body makes less of it.

266
03:24:53,030 --> 03:24:55,157
And this could give us some insight into

267
03:24:55,157 --> 03:24:56,450
why kids seem to run hot

268
03:24:56,450 --> 03:24:59,078
and our parents or grandparents seem to run cold.

269
03:24:59,203 --> 03:25:03,374
Older people, they certainly have much less brown fat

270
03:25:03,582 --> 03:25:05,918
in terms of absolute and relative amounts.

271
03:25:06,127 --> 03:25:07,295
There's also less muscle,

272
03:25:07,295 --> 03:25:09,255
which is also important for generating heat.

273
03:25:09,255 --> 03:25:11,424
The similarities between brown fat and muscle

274
03:25:11,424 --> 03:25:12,967
don't end there, though.

275
03:25:12,967 --> 03:25:16,304
If you work your brown fat out, it also increases volume

276
03:25:16,554 --> 03:25:19,098
and the way you do this is by exposing yourself

277
03:25:19,098 --> 03:25:21,559
to the cold for extended periods of time,

278
03:25:21,767 --> 03:25:24,228
as this 2014 study shows.

279
03:25:24,228 --> 03:25:26,897
Look at how much more brown fat these men from Maryland

280
03:25:26,897 --> 03:25:29,567
had after a month of exposure to cold temperatures.

281
03:25:29,984 --> 03:25:31,736
And look how much less they had

282
03:25:31,736 --> 03:25:33,738
when exposed to warm temperatures.

283
03:25:33,738 --> 03:25:36,115
Which gives us some insight into why 55 degrees in

284
03:25:36,115 --> 03:25:37,783
the winter can feel so much warmer

285
03:25:37,783 --> 03:25:40,244
than 55 degrees in the fall.

286
03:25:40,244 --> 03:25:42,371
Brown fat doesn't just keep you warm, though.

287
03:25:42,872 --> 03:25:44,999
Scientists have figured out that having more of it

288
03:25:44,999 --> 03:25:48,044
correlates to lower risk of diabetes and heart disease.

289
03:25:48,586 --> 03:25:50,004
Studying the effects of brown fat

290
03:25:50,004 --> 03:25:52,673
using cold exposure is challenging, though.

291
03:25:52,757 --> 03:25:56,010
One challenge is that it's hard to dose cold.

292
03:25:56,093 --> 03:25:58,220
How much... I gave you ‘this’ amount of cold.

293
03:25:58,220 --> 03:25:59,597
I mean, you know the temperature, but

294
03:25:59,597 --> 03:26:00,639
it's hard to know what you're doing

295
03:26:00,639 --> 03:26:01,974
and therefore it's very hard to design a study

296
03:26:01,974 --> 03:26:03,184
where it's reproducible.

297
03:26:03,184 --> 03:26:05,895
So instead, they're trying to activate brown fat

298
03:26:05,895 --> 03:26:09,732
with medicine to study
how burning it affects us biologically.

299
03:26:09,857 --> 03:26:11,776
A medication called Mirabegron,

300
03:26:11,776 --> 03:26:14,070
which is approved to treat overactive

301
03:26:14,070 --> 03:26:16,530
bladder, was able to activate the brown fat

302
03:26:16,530 --> 03:26:17,948
in a way that was very similar

303
03:26:17,948 --> 03:26:20,451
to the effectiveness of the cold exposure.

304
03:26:20,451 --> 03:26:22,870
There's a lot we still don't know about brown fat,

305
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:24,789
but we do know that our bodies

306
03:26:24,789 --> 03:26:26,791
use it to adapt to cold weather.

307
03:26:26,791 --> 03:26:29,502
And when a kid doesn't
want to put a coat on in the winter, it's

308
03:26:29,502 --> 03:26:31,879
not necessarily that they're just stubborn.

309
03:26:32,380 --> 03:26:33,047
It might just be

310
03:26:33,047 --> 03:26:34,340
because they have a little more

311
03:26:34,340 --> 03:26:35,633
of something in their body than

312
03:26:35,633 --> 03:26:35,674
you do.

313
04:28:27,883 --> 04:28:29,176
In Top Gun: Maverick.

314
04:28:29,176 --> 04:28:30,886
All of this...

315
04:28:33,138 --> 04:28:33,889
is real.

316
04:28:34,348 --> 04:28:36,016
These actors trained for months

317
04:28:36,016 --> 04:28:37,726
 to pull up to eight G's

318
04:28:37,726 --> 04:28:39,603
 And cameras mounted inside of the F-18s

319
04:28:39,603 --> 04:28:42,272
captured real intense flying.

320
04:28:42,272 --> 04:28:44,650
Just look at the ripples on Jay Ellis’ face.

321
04:28:45,609 --> 04:28:47,653
But this shot is different,

322
04:28:47,653 --> 04:28:50,322
because this plane doesn't exist.

323
04:28:51,240 --> 04:28:54,493
It's called The Darkstar, and it uses hypersonic technology,

324
04:28:54,576 --> 04:28:56,161
a tool that's in development

325
04:28:56,161 --> 04:28:59,373
by Lockheed Martin,
but nowhere near ready to be used like

326
04:28:59,373 --> 04:29:02,292
Tom 
Cruise's Pete “Maverick” Mitchell does.

327
04:29:02,292 --> 04:29:05,337
This scene is almost entirely fabricated,

328
04:29:05,337 --> 04:29:08,924
from Tom Cruise's convincing sweating and heavy breathing

329
04:29:08,924 --> 04:29:11,343
to the impeccable VFX.

330
04:29:11,343 --> 04:29:13,470
But the thing that grounds it for me

331
04:29:13,470 --> 04:29:14,888
is the sound design,

332
04:29:18,308 --> 04:29:20,519
which is why I talked to this guy.

333
04:29:21,854 --> 04:29:22,813
I'm Al Nelson.

334
04:29:22,813 --> 04:29:27,734
My job on Top Gun: Maverick was to define the soundscape

335
04:29:27,734 --> 04:29:29,820
for the film, from jets,

336
04:29:30,737 --> 04:29:31,488
to doors,

337
04:29:32,823 --> 04:29:33,448
foley,

338
04:29:34,533 --> 04:29:35,033
ambiances

339
04:29:36,076 --> 04:29:37,202
motorcycles,

340
04:29:38,120 --> 04:29:39,830
and all things maverick.

341
04:29:39,830 --> 04:29:40,956
Expectations were high.

342
04:29:40,956 --> 04:29:42,207
The bar was very high.

343
04:29:42,207 --> 04:29:44,960
There wasn't a ‘good enough’ option.

344
04:29:45,043 --> 04:29:47,629
It always needed to be as best as it could be.

345
04:29:47,713 --> 04:29:49,965
When Al's team first got the mach ten sequence,

346
04:29:50,174 --> 04:29:52,176
it sounded something like this:

347
04:29:53,802 --> 04:29:55,971
a blank slate with one big question

348
04:29:56,597 --> 04:29:59,057
How do you make fake flight feel real?

349
04:29:59,600 --> 04:30:01,059
What does the Dark Star sound like?

350
04:30:01,059 --> 04:30:02,769
First of all, working backwards.

351
04:30:02,769 --> 04:30:04,188
It's not an F-18.

352
04:30:04,188 --> 04:30:06,106
It's not a fighter jet.

353
04:30:06,106 --> 04:30:08,525
The Darkstar is much more elegant.

354
04:30:08,567 --> 04:30:10,277
It's much more advanced.

355
04:30:10,277 --> 04:30:12,529
And one of the things that was important

356
04:30:12,529 --> 04:30:14,573
was for that to be believable as well.

357
04:30:14,573 --> 04:30:16,200
It shouldn't sound like a video game.

358
04:30:16,200 --> 04:30:17,993
It can't sound sci fi.

359
04:30:17,993 --> 04:30:19,786
You think, of course, of Star Wars,

360
04:30:19,786 --> 04:30:22,998
you know, the tie fighters are amazing,

361
04:30:22,998 --> 04:30:24,291
but they're sci fi

362
04:30:24,291 --> 04:30:26,710
and they used elephants to make them.

363
04:30:30,547 --> 04:30:32,716
And so we worked hard, lots of field trips

364
04:30:32,716 --> 04:30:35,177
to aircraft carriers, cross-country trips

365
04:30:35,177 --> 04:30:37,971
for jet engines and auxiliary power units.

366
04:30:38,263 --> 04:30:42,226
We are trying to tell the story of Maverick's flight.

367
04:30:42,392 --> 04:30:43,936
Everything we're hearing

368
04:30:43,936 --> 04:30:47,147
and seeing should feel as real as it can feel

369
04:30:47,147 --> 04:30:49,733
so that we're experiencing this with him.

370
04:30:51,109 --> 04:30:53,820
And Al’s job was to make sure that the experience captured

371
04:30:53,820 --> 04:30:55,864
all the intensity of Maverick

372
04:30:55,864 --> 04:30:59,243
pushing the dark star to its limits.

373
04:30:59,243 --> 04:31:02,037
It starts with sounds of technology
that we're familiar with.

374
04:31:02,204 --> 04:31:06,166
So when you see Maverick launch, he's using turbines.

375
04:31:06,625 --> 04:31:10,087
We wanted it to have punch and feel high tech.

376
04:31:10,254 --> 04:31:11,421
It doesn't ramp up.

377
04:31:11,421 --> 04:31:13,799
It just goes ‘ca-chunk’ and then thrust.

378
04:31:14,800 --> 04:31:16,260
Maverick gets up in the air

379
04:31:16,260 --> 04:31:18,762
and, as he starts passing new thresholds...

380
04:31:19,012 --> 04:31:20,555
Increase to mach 3.5.

381
04:31:20,555 --> 04:31:22,432
...there's this subtle beep...

382
04:31:22,432 --> 04:31:24,434
Increase to mach 3.5 

383
04:31:24,434 --> 04:31:27,104
..that starts a simmering build of tension.

384
04:31:27,479 --> 04:31:30,941
Like Pavlov's
dogs, we're being trained to know that this tone

385
04:31:30,941 --> 04:31:34,194
will keep repeating until we get to the coveted mach ten.

386
04:31:34,861 --> 04:31:37,364
But before that, he has to go faster,

387
04:31:37,864 --> 04:31:40,993
this time using technology that most of us don't yet

388
04:31:40,993 --> 04:31:42,286
have a reference for.

389
04:31:42,286 --> 04:31:44,204
Transitioning to scramjet.

390
04:31:45,038 --> 04:31:46,039
A scramjet

391
04:31:46,039 --> 04:31:48,917
uses the speed of the jet

392
04:31:49,126 --> 04:31:51,420
to intake oxygen, which ignites

393
04:31:51,420 --> 04:31:53,672
the fuel as opposed to a turbine.

394
04:31:54,131 --> 04:31:56,174
A turbine can only spin so fast

395
04:31:56,174 --> 04:32:00,053
and can only generate so much oxygen to ignite the fuel.

396
04:32:00,095 --> 04:32:03,265
All of that process needed to be articulated sonically.

397
04:32:03,348 --> 04:32:04,766
He kicks it in the scramjet

398
04:32:04,766 --> 04:32:07,102
and then you see the turbines close

399
04:32:07,269 --> 04:32:10,314
and you see the tube open up in the back of the Darkstar.

400
04:32:10,314 --> 04:32:12,983
At that point, you've got this flow of air

401
04:32:13,233 --> 04:32:17,112
going into the jet system and igniting that fuel

402
04:32:17,279 --> 04:32:21,116
and creating that rocket.

403
04:32:21,116 --> 04:32:23,410
And then the plane is on its way.

404
04:32:23,744 --> 04:32:25,245
Maverick starts getting comfortable.

405
04:32:25,245 --> 04:32:26,747
We’re feeling good.

406
04:32:26,913 --> 04:32:28,498
And the soundscape reflects that,

407
04:32:28,498 --> 04:32:30,584
by becoming slightly more subdued.

408
04:32:30,584 --> 04:32:33,378
Because the other thing we're doing specifically with

409
04:32:33,378 --> 04:32:36,131
Dark Star is we are trying to tell the story

410
04:32:36,131 --> 04:32:40,344
of his joy of being in this flight and achieving

411
04:32:40,510 --> 04:32:42,763
that which no one has done before.

412
04:32:42,763 --> 04:32:44,222
He's the fastest man alive.

413
04:32:44,222 --> 04:32:45,682
And so there are moments

414
04:32:45,682 --> 04:32:48,560
where we're just with him as he's smiling.

415
04:32:48,810 --> 04:32:51,229
The plane focused sound design pulls back

416
04:32:51,229 --> 04:32:53,440
and other elements take the forefront.

417
04:32:53,690 --> 04:32:54,691
It's a lot of layers,

418
04:32:54,691 --> 04:32:57,527
but it's also it's not necessarily accumulating.

419
04:32:57,944 --> 04:32:58,945
It's alternating.

420
04:32:58,945 --> 04:32:59,863
It's orchestrating.

421
04:32:59,863 --> 04:33:01,573
You know, when he says, Talk to me, Goose,

422
04:33:02,991 --> 04:33:04,576
there's not a lot else going on,

423
04:33:04,576 --> 04:33:06,828
because we are with him emotionally.

424
04:33:07,037 --> 04:33:09,373
You see the dark star go off in the distance.

425
04:33:09,373 --> 04:33:11,375
That's very much a music moment.

426
04:33:11,416 --> 04:33:13,460
So you don't need a lot from us at that point.

427
04:33:13,460 --> 04:33:14,961
And we're just a dot

428
04:33:14,961 --> 04:33:17,047
and we're just a little rip as you hear it.

429
04:33:17,297 --> 04:33:18,382
Scan across the sky

430
04:33:18,382 --> 04:33:21,510
so you can track it and then the music drops out

431
04:33:21,510 --> 04:33:25,555
very dramatically and we cut to him and it's boom.

432
04:33:25,847 --> 04:33:27,891
And you feel a little bit of shaking

433
04:33:27,891 --> 04:33:29,601
and you hear that turbine kick on

434
04:33:29,601 --> 04:33:32,145
and you feel those thrusters.

435
04:33:32,479 --> 04:33:35,857
Instead of having all these clips
sound fade into each other,

436
04:33:35,982 --> 04:33:38,652
you feel every single cut.

437
04:33:42,364 --> 04:33:44,157
One of my first interactions with Tom.

438
04:33:44,157 --> 04:33:46,034
He said ‘the cuts have to hit.

439
04:33:46,034 --> 04:33:49,246
They have to punch.’ He was very, very emphatic about that.

440
04:33:49,413 --> 04:33:53,834
And it's a style that the first Top Gun established,

441
04:33:54,376 --> 04:33:58,964
that aggressive cutting, style of cutting from inside

442
04:33:58,964 --> 04:34:01,842
and being just dialog and rather quiet

443
04:34:01,842 --> 04:34:04,219
to banging on to the exteriors.

444
04:34:04,886 --> 04:34:05,470
Coming left!

445
04:34:06,763 --> 04:34:09,015
And it makes the cut feel aggressive.

446
04:34:09,015 --> 04:34:11,351
It makes the film feel aggressive and dangerous,

447
04:34:11,393 --> 04:34:13,437
and it propels us in the story.

448
04:34:13,645 --> 04:34:16,231
Each of these cuts has a unique sonic texture.

449
04:34:16,231 --> 04:34:18,817
You cut to the rear and it just bangs on

450
04:34:18,817 --> 04:34:22,070
with this ripping, tearing rocket thruster.

451
04:34:22,821 --> 04:34:25,073
And you see all of those currents

452
04:34:25,073 --> 04:34:27,284
crossing the wings, the jet stream.

453
04:34:27,284 --> 04:34:29,244
It's such a beautiful visual.

454
04:34:29,244 --> 04:34:31,246
And we wanted to put something in there

455
04:34:31,246 --> 04:34:34,124
that was tonal and special, which was the Roebling

456
04:34:34,124 --> 04:34:37,127
Suspension Bridge.

457
04:34:38,420 --> 04:34:39,754
So all of these flavors

458
04:34:39,754 --> 04:34:43,341
allow it to be constantly changing and constantly new

459
04:34:43,800 --> 04:34:45,886
and hopefully exciting.

460
04:34:46,803 --> 04:34:48,763
To ratchet up that building tension,

461
04:34:48,763 --> 04:34:51,558
Al’s team used a longtime sound design trick,

462
04:34:51,892 --> 04:34:54,352
the Shepard Tone, an auditory illusion,

463
04:34:54,352 --> 04:34:57,314
where you loop a sound wave separated by octaves,

464
04:34:57,481 --> 04:34:59,149
which tricks your brain into thinking

465
04:34:59,149 --> 04:35:01,276
that it's a continually rising pitch.

466
04:35:01,610 --> 04:35:05,489
Listen to it here in the rising turbines.

467
04:35:07,782 --> 04:35:10,702
So the jet is starting to complain a little bit

468
04:35:10,702 --> 04:35:12,496
and so more tones are happening.

469
04:35:12,496 --> 04:35:16,208
And yes, that mach 9.7, 9.8

470
04:35:16,458 --> 04:35:18,710
each time it's a little bit louder, a little bit higher.

471
04:35:18,752 --> 04:35:20,754
It's that winding you up.

472
04:35:20,962 --> 04:35:22,923
And then the minute he does it, catharsis.

473
04:35:23,632 --> 04:35:25,300
Mach 10! [cheers]

474
04:35:25,300 --> 04:35:26,676
Catharsis

475
04:35:28,970 --> 04:35:31,097
But just when you think it's over,

476
04:35:32,224 --> 04:35:34,142
we return to quiet

477
04:35:34,142 --> 04:35:36,394
and then we start again with the build.

478
04:35:36,394 --> 04:35:37,229
Oh, don't do it.

479
04:35:37,229 --> 04:35:37,896
Don't do it.

480
04:35:37,896 --> 04:35:42,859
Just a little push.

481
04:35:42,859 --> 04:35:44,986
But this time the build is different.

482
04:35:45,320 --> 04:35:47,614
It starts with this beep from inside the control room,

483
04:35:47,906 --> 04:35:50,825
which plays off this last beep from the Darkstar's cockpit.

484
04:35:51,284 --> 04:35:54,120
When you listen to them both next to each other,

485
04:35:54,120 --> 04:35:56,665
it's a rising tone and then a falling tone.

486
04:35:56,915 --> 04:36:02,754
And this subtly signals that danger is coming.

487
04:36:02,754 --> 04:36:04,548
The shepherd tone kicks in louder

488
04:36:04,548 --> 04:36:06,341
and more grating than before.

489
04:36:06,341 --> 04:36:08,218
It leaks into the sound muted cabin.

490
04:36:08,218 --> 04:36:10,428
So we know that the pressure is building

491
04:36:10,845 --> 04:36:12,931
and it keeps building until...

492
04:36:16,977 --> 04:36:19,521
[Explosion]

493
04:36:19,521 --> 04:36:20,772
You know, it took some hard work

494
04:36:20,772 --> 04:36:23,066
to get us to this final version.

495
04:36:23,316 --> 04:36:24,734
Did some late nights and long hours,

496
04:36:24,734 --> 04:36:26,361
but I'm very pleased

497
04:36:26,361 --> 04:36:28,446
and excited with with how it's been received

498
04:36:28,446 --> 04:36:29,656
and how it sounds.

499
04:36:31,116 --> 04:36:35,370
I know they did design an actual Darkstar that he sat in.

500
04:36:35,370 --> 04:36:37,956
You can see him sitting in it
and then at a certain point it launches

501
04:36:37,956 --> 04:36:40,292
over our head
and that's when we get into the magic of cinema.

502
04:36:40,375 --> 04:36:44,838
That was an F-18 that they
then remapped the Darkstar over it.

503
04:36:44,838 --> 04:36:46,673
And that jet was so low

504
04:36:46,673 --> 04:36:47,966
that when you see the roof

505
04:36:47,966 --> 04:36:50,760
of that shed blow off, that was real.

506
04:36:50,760 --> 04:36:53,722
That was an unexpected addition.

507
04:36:54,306 --> 04:36:57,767
And the fact that Ed Harris just stands there and takes it

508
04:36:59,060 --> 04:37:00,937
like that guy is

509
04:37:00,937 --> 04:37:01,855
something else.

510
13:08:12,787 --> 13:08:14,121
Maybe this was a mistake.

511
13:08:22,630 --> 13:08:25,508
The United States has always had 
a love hate relationship

512
13:08:25,508 --> 13:08:26,801
when it comes to train travel.

513
13:08:27,176 --> 13:08:30,054
The country was literally built
on the backs of the railroads

514
13:08:30,054 --> 13:08:31,931
and the US used to have the biggest 

515
13:08:31,931 --> 13:08:34,684
and the most well-funded 
rail network in the world.

516
13:08:35,434 --> 13:08:37,186
But if you ask anybody 
that's taken the Amtrak...

517
13:08:37,228 --> 13:08:39,605
they'll tell you that that's not exactly 
the case anymore.

518
13:08:41,399 --> 13:08:44,193
The US has fallen woefully behind 
the rest of the world

519
13:08:44,193 --> 13:08:45,444
when it comes to train travel.

520
13:08:45,736 --> 13:08:47,280
So what the heck happened?

521
13:08:47,822 --> 13:08:49,949
How did the United States 
get so far behind?

522
13:08:49,949 --> 13:08:51,909
And does it have any chance 
of catching up?

523
13:08:52,868 --> 13:08:54,996
To find out the answer to that, 
I'm going to take the Amtrak

524
13:08:54,996 --> 13:08:57,456
from here in Los Angeles all the way 
to New York City.

525
13:08:57,832 --> 13:08:59,542
And I'm going to have plenty 
of time to think about it

526
13:08:59,542 --> 13:09:02,545
since it's a... 70-hour journey.

527
13:09:03,045 --> 13:09:04,171
I guess I better get started.

528
13:09:23,816 --> 13:09:24,984
The entire length of my journey

529
13:09:24,984 --> 13:09:28,112
from Los Angeles to New York 
is about four days long...

530
13:09:28,404 --> 13:09:30,197
and for the first leg of my journey

531
13:09:30,197 --> 13:09:32,074
there weren't any sleeper cars available.

532
13:09:32,366 --> 13:09:33,868
So, this is what my living space

533
13:09:33,868 --> 13:09:35,578
looks like for the next two days

534
13:09:35,578 --> 13:09:38,122
which as somebody that's 
[BEEP] years old

535
13:09:38,122 --> 13:09:39,665
should be really good for my back.

536
13:09:40,124 --> 13:09:42,209
The journey I'm taking 
is pretty different

537
13:09:42,209 --> 13:09:44,253
than it would have been about 
a hundred years ago.

538
13:09:44,420 --> 13:09:47,298
To see the differences, 
let's take a look at this US map.

539
13:09:47,715 --> 13:09:52,887
The year is 1916 and there's about 
254,000 miles of railroads

540
13:09:52,887 --> 13:09:55,181
the highest number there's ever been 
in this country.

541
13:09:55,848 --> 13:09:59,518
The Pennsylvania railroad, or the Pennsy,
as it was referred to...

542
13:10:00,061 --> 13:10:00,853
I feel like that nickname

543
13:10:00,853 --> 13:10:02,563
could have probably used 
a little more work.

544
13:10:02,897 --> 13:10:04,940
Nevertheless, it was the largest corporation

545
13:10:04,940 --> 13:10:06,484
in the world at the time.

546
13:10:06,692 --> 13:10:10,196
It's difficult to illustrate how influential 
these companies were...

547
13:10:10,237 --> 13:10:11,322
and how much railroads

548
13:10:11,322 --> 13:10:14,075
were into woven into the fabric 
of American life.

549
13:10:14,617 --> 13:10:16,786
They were responsible for 
the temples of their time...

550
13:10:17,078 --> 13:10:19,205
like Penn and Grand Central stations.

551
13:10:19,747 --> 13:10:22,291
Also, you would not believe how amazing

552
13:10:22,291 --> 13:10:23,793
train travel could be back then.

553
13:10:23,918 --> 13:10:27,630
Sure, they had basic boring train cars
like the one I’m riding.

554
13:10:27,630 --> 13:10:29,131
But the upscale trains featured

555
13:10:29,131 --> 13:10:31,384
chandeliers, barber shops...

556
13:10:31,884 --> 13:10:34,095
pianos and food service

557
13:10:34,095 --> 13:10:36,722
that would make the Four Seasons 
look like Boston Market.

558
13:10:37,348 --> 13:10:40,476
One menu featured oysters, 
consommé...

559
13:10:40,893 --> 13:10:42,395
and celery fed duck.

560
13:10:43,020 --> 13:10:44,438
The bad news is my train

561
13:10:44,438 --> 13:10:46,982
didn't have ducks that were 
fed anything.

562
13:10:47,608 --> 13:10:50,236
I ate the Thai Red Curry Street noodles

563
13:10:50,236 --> 13:10:53,864
which, although I'm pretty sure they were 
just a microwave frozen package

564
13:10:53,864 --> 13:10:54,990
were actually pretty good.

565
13:10:55,533 --> 13:10:59,412
And although the accommodations 
were a far cry from crystal chandeliers

566
13:10:59,412 --> 13:11:00,538
they were comfortable enough.

567
13:11:02,790 --> 13:11:04,500
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

568
13:11:04,542 --> 13:11:06,335
This is the conductor speaking.

569
13:11:06,377 --> 13:11:09,088
It has now been 5 hours and 15 minutes

570
13:11:09,088 --> 13:11:12,550
which is the time it takes to fly from LAX 
to Newark Airport.

571
13:11:12,842 --> 13:11:15,636
And we are still in California.

572
13:11:17,430 --> 13:11:18,431
It's only 9:00

573
13:11:18,431 --> 13:11:20,015
but it already got dark outside

574
13:11:20,015 --> 13:11:21,725
so there's nothing to look at 
through the window...

575
13:11:22,143 --> 13:11:24,228
and there's no Wi-Fi, apparently.

576
13:11:24,228 --> 13:11:26,939
So I guess I'm just going to 
go to sleep.

577
13:11:27,148 --> 13:11:29,066
They leave the overhead lights 
on all night

578
13:11:29,108 --> 13:11:31,485
but luckily I brought 
my trusty eye mask.

579
13:11:32,236 --> 13:11:34,738
I also brought some earplugs,
which should come in handy

580
13:11:34,738 --> 13:11:37,741
because I'm sitting right in front 
of some iPad kids

581
13:11:37,741 --> 13:11:40,786
who are watching movies at 
full volume with no headphones.

582
13:11:41,495 --> 13:11:42,705
So, that's fun.

583
13:11:43,038 --> 13:11:43,497
All right.

584
13:11:43,497 --> 13:11:44,707
I'll see you in the morning.

585
13:11:52,173 --> 13:11:55,384
Did I sleep well last night? Hmm?

586
13:11:56,385 --> 13:11:58,345
I'm going to say no.

587
13:11:58,721 --> 13:12:00,514
I'll spare you the details

588
13:12:00,514 --> 13:12:02,975
but imagine getting literally 
kicked in the head 

589
13:12:02,975 --> 13:12:04,560
by the woman in the seat next to you.

590
13:12:04,810 --> 13:12:07,521
I wound up retreating to the 
observation car to sleep...

591
13:12:08,105 --> 13:12:09,482
which was less than ideal.

592
13:12:15,696 --> 13:12:17,198
Like an astronaut in space.

593
13:12:17,198 --> 13:12:19,116
I'm trying to move around 
as much as I can

594
13:12:19,116 --> 13:12:21,785
so that my muscles don't deteriorate 
during my journey.

595
13:12:22,286 --> 13:12:24,330
So let's talk about how American trains

596
13:12:24,330 --> 13:12:27,166
went from gilded pleasure palaces to...

597
13:12:27,374 --> 13:12:28,250
This.

598
13:12:28,667 --> 13:12:30,085
Part of the reason why railroads 

599
13:12:30,085 --> 13:12:32,671
became so wildly successful 
in the first place...

600
13:12:32,880 --> 13:12:34,048
is because they were run by

601
13:12:34,048 --> 13:12:37,051
what were affectionately termed 
“robber barons”.

602
13:12:37,343 --> 13:12:39,178
Men like Cornelius Vanderbilt...

603
13:12:39,720 --> 13:12:43,891
Jay Gould, James Fisk,
and J.P. Morgan.

604
13:12:43,891 --> 13:12:47,895
These guys were ruthless, anti-labor,
and really corrupt...

605
13:12:48,187 --> 13:12:49,772
which was great when it came to building

606
13:12:49,772 --> 13:12:52,775
an expansive kingdom of highly profitable 
rail companies...

607
13:12:52,900 --> 13:12:56,529
but bad when it came to... 
just about everything else.

608
13:12:56,737 --> 13:13:00,032
As a result, the train companies became 
pretty universally hated

609
13:13:00,032 --> 13:13:01,242
by the general public.

610
13:13:01,492 --> 13:13:04,411
As seen in what passed for 
scathing satire at the time.

611
13:13:04,703 --> 13:13:05,788
“Now then, Jim.”

612
13:13:05,788 --> 13:13:07,122
“No jockeying, you know.”

613
13:13:07,414 --> 13:13:08,624
“Let em rip, Commodore.”

614
13:13:08,999 --> 13:13:10,834
“Don't stop to water or you'll be beat.”

615
13:13:11,252 --> 13:13:12,169
The federal government

616
13:13:12,169 --> 13:13:14,672
saw the kind of crap these guys 
were pulling and was like

617
13:13:14,713 --> 13:13:17,675
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, 
you can't do that.”

618
13:13:18,008 --> 13:13:20,094
So they instituted a bunch of regulations...

619
13:13:20,344 --> 13:13:21,637
which, among other things...

620
13:13:21,845 --> 13:13:23,973
set fixed rates for the railroad companies.

621
13:13:24,181 --> 13:13:25,266
And also prevented them

622
13:13:25,266 --> 13:13:27,518
from raising their fares or 
changing their service

623
13:13:27,518 --> 13:13:28,852
without the government's permission.

624
13:13:29,103 --> 13:13:31,730
This didn't seem like that big 
of a deal at the time...

625
13:13:31,981 --> 13:13:34,567
because as historian Robert Selph Henry said...

626
13:13:34,692 --> 13:13:36,902
“The problem , to some minds at least

627
13:13:36,902 --> 13:13:39,446
was how to keep railroads from 
making too much money.”

628
13:13:39,572 --> 13:13:42,241
After all, railroads were still by far

629
13:13:42,241 --> 13:13:45,411
the most efficient and the best way 
for most people to travel.

630
13:13:45,661 --> 13:13:48,330
This all obviously changed when 
affordable automobiles

631
13:13:48,330 --> 13:13:51,458
and later air travel came into the picture.

632
13:13:52,001 --> 13:13:54,128
so much so that by 1956

633
13:13:54,128 --> 13:13:57,214
only 4% of passenger travel 
was on trains.

634
13:13:57,548 --> 13:14:00,092
When you take into account 
that 40 years earlier

635
13:14:00,092 --> 13:14:01,927
that number was 98%

636
13:14:01,927 --> 13:14:03,429
you can see how much 
the US’s priorities

637
13:14:03,429 --> 13:14:05,848
had shifted when it came to travel.

638
13:14:06,390 --> 13:14:08,934
The train companies were far from 
a monopoly anymore...

639
13:14:09,226 --> 13:14:11,520
but they were still being regulated 
as if they were...

640
13:14:11,770 --> 13:14:12,688
which was killing them.

641
13:14:14,523 --> 13:14:16,984
Okay, so, right now we are being
held on the tracks

642
13:14:16,984 --> 13:14:18,235
to let a freight train pass.

643
13:14:18,485 --> 13:14:21,071
And this is actually the perfect time 
to talk about something.

644
13:14:21,447 --> 13:14:23,532
Private commercial passenger trains

645
13:14:23,532 --> 13:14:25,200
have never been very profitable.

646
13:14:26,910 --> 13:14:28,287
The lifeblood of the industry

647
13:14:28,287 --> 13:14:31,332
has always been these: 
Freight trains.

648
13:14:31,707 --> 13:14:33,876
But rail companies were always 
forced to provide

649
13:14:33,876 --> 13:14:36,503
passengers service as a benefit 
to the public.

650
13:14:36,545 --> 13:14:38,464
So when the rail companies began to suffer

651
13:14:38,464 --> 13:14:41,342
and then eventually fold, the government 
had the idea

652
13:14:41,342 --> 13:14:44,011
to take the responsibility for passenger service

653
13:14:44,011 --> 13:14:45,971
off the plates of the rail companies

654
13:14:45,971 --> 13:14:48,849
who could then focus on the profitable 
freight side of the business.

655
13:14:49,058 --> 13:14:50,809
They took all the passenger service

656
13:14:50,809 --> 13:14:52,603
and combined it into one company.

657
13:14:52,936 --> 13:14:55,856
Which is how in 1971 we got Amtrak.

658
13:14:56,231 --> 13:14:58,692
Which stands for the American Train Track.

659
13:14:58,942 --> 13:15:01,236
Again, what is up with these nicknames?

660
13:15:01,528 --> 13:15:03,739
“Amtrak makes it easy come, easy go

661
13:15:03,739 --> 13:15:06,367
to more than 450 cities in the USA.”

662
13:15:06,575 --> 13:15:07,910
But here is the thing.

663
13:15:08,285 --> 13:15:11,163
Amtrak was designed to fail 
from the beginning.

664
13:15:11,830 --> 13:15:15,125
That may sound ridiculous, 
but let me explain.

665
13:15:15,459 --> 13:15:16,418
First of all

666
13:15:16,418 --> 13:15:19,838
the government created Amtrak 
as a for profit corporation

667
13:15:19,838 --> 13:15:23,008
despite the fact that virtually 
no passenger service

668
13:15:23,008 --> 13:15:24,718
anywhere has been profitable.

669
13:15:25,010 --> 13:15:28,097
After all, the government broke off 
all the passenger trains

670
13:15:28,097 --> 13:15:30,808
from the rail companies because 
they weren't making money.

671
13:15:31,100 --> 13:15:32,893
When the government formed Amtrak

672
13:15:33,143 --> 13:15:37,398
they tasked it with employing innovative 
operating and marketing concepts

673
13:15:37,398 --> 13:15:40,275
to develop the potential of 
modern rail service.

674
13:15:40,651 --> 13:15:42,778
And how much did Congress give them 
to do that in their

675
13:15:42,778 --> 13:15:43,987
first year of operation?

676
13:15:45,030 --> 13:15:46,740
Just $40 million.

677
13:15:47,408 --> 13:15:49,451
Their budget has gone up 
a lot since then.

678
13:15:49,702 --> 13:15:53,706
Their budget for the year 2022 
was $2.3 billion...

679
13:15:53,831 --> 13:15:55,290
which sounds like a lot, doesn't it?

680
13:15:55,708 --> 13:15:58,252
But when you take into account that 
the federal highway budget

681
13:15:58,252 --> 13:16:01,588
for the same year was $64.3 billion

682
13:16:01,588 --> 13:16:03,132
you begin to see the inequity.

683
13:16:03,841 --> 13:16:05,801
To put it even more 
into perspective...

684
13:16:05,926 --> 13:16:08,887
the sum total of all the subsidies 
that the US

685
13:16:08,887 --> 13:16:12,182
has allocated to Amtrak 
in its entire history...

686
13:16:12,474 --> 13:16:15,936
is less than one year's funding for 
the interstate highway system.

687
13:16:16,353 --> 13:16:18,564
This right here shows where America's

688
13:16:18,564 --> 13:16:20,607
priorities lie when it comes to travel...

689
13:16:21,150 --> 13:16:25,112
and why Amtrak has failed 
to majorly expand or innovate.

690
13:16:30,659 --> 13:16:32,286
Okay, so we just got to Chicago.

691
13:16:32,286 --> 13:16:36,081
I got off the Amtrak about 45 hours 
after I left Los Angeles.

692
13:16:36,331 --> 13:16:37,750
And needless to say...

693
13:16:38,709 --> 13:16:40,711
I do not smell very good.

694
13:16:40,961 --> 13:16:43,505
I have about a 7 hour layover 
here in Chicago.

695
13:16:43,505 --> 13:16:45,549
And right now I'm in Union Station...

696
13:16:45,841 --> 13:16:48,051
which is actually kind of amazing.

697
13:16:55,392 --> 13:16:56,643
As you see

698
13:16:56,643 --> 13:16:58,604
I got a chance to put on 
some clean clothes

699
13:16:58,604 --> 13:16:59,813
which feels amazing.

700
13:17:00,105 --> 13:17:02,232
And now I'm just here 
in Millennium Park...

701
13:17:02,524 --> 13:17:05,152
rolling around with my suitcase 
like a dang tourist.

702
13:17:05,569 --> 13:17:07,654
And I'm just trying to enjoy...

703
13:17:08,280 --> 13:17:10,365
not being on a train 
as much as possible

704
13:17:10,365 --> 13:17:11,742
before I get on the second leg.

705
13:17:12,201 --> 13:17:13,911
The second and final leg 
of my journey.

706
13:17:21,710 --> 13:17:23,629
I've achieved the Holy Grail...

707
13:17:24,129 --> 13:17:25,923
of my own private room.

708
13:17:26,340 --> 13:17:28,842
I want to show you my favorite feature 
of the entire room.

709
13:17:28,926 --> 13:17:30,135
You're going to like this.

710
13:17:34,890 --> 13:17:36,308
Hidden sink.

711
13:17:36,809 --> 13:17:38,310
This train is a little bit more...

712
13:17:39,269 --> 13:17:41,730
dynamic, shall we say, 
than the last one.

713
13:17:42,898 --> 13:17:46,318
But I'm hoping that all 
the movements...

714
13:17:46,652 --> 13:17:49,029
will just help rock me to sleep.

715
13:17:56,119 --> 13:17:57,996
When I woke up, we had 
reached Ohio...

716
13:17:58,455 --> 13:18:00,749
about 2600 miles through 
my journey

717
13:18:00,749 --> 13:18:02,459
and 50 something hours.

718
13:18:03,836 --> 13:18:05,087
There are a lot of reasons

719
13:18:05,087 --> 13:18:07,256
why people still want to 
take the train.

720
13:18:07,589 --> 13:18:09,091
A big one is the environment.

721
13:18:09,424 --> 13:18:12,010
According to a study by 
the University of Pennsylvania...

722
13:18:12,302 --> 13:18:14,346
a long distance train trip produces

723
13:18:14,346 --> 13:18:17,099
37% less emissions 
than taking a flight.

724
13:18:17,641 --> 13:18:20,060
Trains are also much safer than cars.

725
13:18:20,435 --> 13:18:22,688
You're 17 times more likely to die

726
13:18:22,688 --> 13:18:24,523
while driving than 
taking a train.

727
13:18:24,898 --> 13:18:26,733
Flying and driving can be faster

728
13:18:26,733 --> 13:18:29,278
and sometimes even cheaper 
than taking the Amtrak.

729
13:18:29,611 --> 13:18:32,406
But they're both often 
miserable experiences.

730
13:18:32,698 --> 13:18:33,866
Going through TSA

731
13:18:33,866 --> 13:18:36,910
dealing with flight delays or 
being stuck in traffic

732
13:18:36,910 --> 13:18:38,495
and not being able to do anything

733
13:18:38,495 --> 13:18:40,247
because you need to be 
driving the car.

734
13:18:40,414 --> 13:18:41,582
While I've been on Amtrak

735
13:18:41,582 --> 13:18:43,500
I've been able to just 
stare out the window

736
13:18:43,500 --> 13:18:44,877
and see the country go by...

737
13:18:45,168 --> 13:18:48,463
or read a book or take a nap 
or whatever.

738
13:18:48,630 --> 13:18:50,340
I've been able to wander 
around the train

739
13:18:50,340 --> 13:18:52,384
whenever I want and stretch my legs.

740
13:18:52,509 --> 13:18:55,512
And I've had the enjoyment
of having my own private little room.

741
13:18:55,804 --> 13:18:58,056
And this is with Amtrak being perpetually

742
13:18:58,056 --> 13:18:59,933
and profoundly underfunded.

743
13:19:00,309 --> 13:19:03,228
Imagine what it would be like if this were evened out.

744
13:19:30,464 --> 13:19:31,715
So, I made it. 

745
13:19:31,715 --> 13:19:36,845
All total, took me about 72 hours 
and 17 minutes...

746
13:19:37,554 --> 13:19:39,765
which granted it would have 
taken me between

747
13:19:39,765 --> 13:19:41,975
5 and 6 hours to fly that distance.

748
13:19:43,435 --> 13:19:45,771
I don't actually know the distance
off the top of my head

749
13:19:45,771 --> 13:19:48,065
but I'm going to add it in post right here.

750
13:19:48,649 --> 13:19:50,317
But here's the thing.

751
13:19:51,109 --> 13:19:52,319
I had a good time.

752
13:19:52,444 --> 13:19:54,029
It was actually really fun.

753
13:19:54,029 --> 13:19:56,490
Aside from a couple of hiccups 
at the very beginning.

754
13:19:57,658 --> 13:20:00,994
It was a really pleasant, 
memorable experience.

755
13:20:02,079 --> 13:20:05,624
I got to see parts of the country
that I had never seen before.

756
13:20:06,124 --> 13:20:10,712
And overall, dare I say, it was 
a pleasant experience.

757
13:20:11,421 --> 13:20:12,798
Right now, Amtrak covers 

758
13:20:12,798 --> 13:20:16,176
roughly 21,000 miles of passenger rail 
in the US.

759
13:20:16,301 --> 13:20:18,762
But when you look at the map, 
you can see it's sparse coverage

760
13:20:18,762 --> 13:20:21,139
routes that don't connect...

761
13:20:21,556 --> 13:20:23,642
And sorry, Wyoming and South Dakota

762
13:20:23,642 --> 13:20:24,810
you don't get any trains.

763
13:20:25,143 --> 13:20:27,938
If the United States took Amtrak 
off life support...

764
13:20:28,230 --> 13:20:31,441
it would revolutionize the way 
people travel around the US.

765
13:20:31,483 --> 13:20:32,818
When he was retiring

766
13:20:32,818 --> 13:20:35,237
former Amtrak President Graham Calder said...

767
13:20:35,487 --> 13:20:38,198
“When I came to Amtrak
I was convinced I could save it...”

768
13:20:38,573 --> 13:20:40,075
But finally came to the conclusion

769
13:20:40,075 --> 13:20:42,119
that only the American public 
can save it...

770
13:20:42,285 --> 13:20:43,537
“...when they say they want it.”

771
13:20:44,705 --> 13:20:45,831
Now, if you'll excuse me

772
13:20:45,831 --> 13:20:47,791
I'm going to go take a much needed shower

773
13:20:47,791 --> 13:20:49,710
and go to sleep 
in a real bed.

774
13:20:50,293 --> 13:20:52,587
I got to rest up for my flight back 
to California tomorrow.

775
13:20:56,341 --> 13:20:59,219
For me, one of the best parts of riding

776
13:20:59,219 --> 13:21:02,973
the Amtrak is just throwing on 
some Phoebe Bridgers

777
13:21:02,973 --> 13:21:06,476
and wistfully staring out the window 
for hours on end.
