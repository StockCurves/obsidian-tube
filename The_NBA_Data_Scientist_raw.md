#### [0001](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=0.929,7.645)  
If you're a basketball fan, you know your team's big stars, head coach, maybe even the rookie bench warmers.  ^TND0001

#### [0002](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=7.645,13.624)  
But you probably know very little about the Ph.D. mathematicians like this woman.  ^TND0002

#### [0003](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=13.624,16.212)  
Her job is to crunch the numbers of the game.  ^TND0003

#### [0004](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=16.212,20.117)  
We're all in sort of an arm's race to acquire information.  ^TND0004

#### [0005](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=20.117,24.223)  
And she's turning basketball into a hard, cold science.  ^TND0005

#### [0006](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=24.223,28.39)  
My name is Ivana Seric and I'm a data scientist.  ^TND0006

#### [0007](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=42.449,46.459)  
For many years, Philly was a tough place to be a basketball fan.  ^TND0007

#### [0008](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=47.356,54.578)  
But having reached the top eight in the playoffs for a second season in a row, the 76ers right now are in a renaissance.  ^TND0008

#### [0009](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=54.578,57.918)  
Embiid fakes, Embiid down the lane.  ^TND0009

#### [0010](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=57.918,64.263)  
Just across the river is where the team's been hard at work and it's where I went to go meet Ivana in April.  ^TND0010

#### [0011](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=64.263,72.05)  
This 125,000 square foot facility comes with all the features you'd expect from an NBA training complex.  ^TND0011

#### [0012](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=72.05,77.54)  
It also features the office of people like Ivana who support the team behind the scenes.  ^TND0012

#### [0013](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=77.54,82.38)  
My job involves analyzing the data that we have from NBA games.  ^TND0013

#### [0014](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=82.38,85.597)  
My focus is mostly on the coaching strategy.  ^TND0014

#### [0015](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=85.597,86.995)  
Coaches have a lot of intuition.  ^TND0015

#### [0016](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=86.995,95.713)  
They know the game, they know the players, but we try to complete their picture of the players with data, which is hopefully unbiased.  ^TND0016

#### [0017](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=95.713,99.392)  
Ivana is part of the Sixers 10-person analytics team.  ^TND0017

#### [0018](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=99.392,105.063)  
The work of these statisticians has already forced a profound change in the game of basketball.  ^TND0018

#### [0019](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=105.063,107.077)  
Teams are taking more three point shots.  ^TND0019

#### [0020](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=107.077,108.934)  
Embiid for three.  ^TND0020

#### [0021](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=108.934,116.698)  
Even though we make them at lower percentage than the shots closer to the basket, but they're worth more points and the trade off actually pays off.  ^TND0021

#### [0022](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=116.698,119.039)  
Take a look at this clip from the '80's.  ^TND0022

#### [0023](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=119.039,122.233)  
See how all the players are bunched up right by the hoop?  ^TND0023

#### [0024](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=122.233,123.934)  
Compare that with today.  ^TND0024

#### [0025](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=123.934,128.455)  
More and more of the action is taking place at the three point line.  ^TND0025

#### [0026](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=128.455,133.249)  
Of course, it's not just basketball that's been reshaped by analytics.  ^TND0026

#### [0027](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=133.249,143.534)  
Businesses of all kinds are tracking a ton of information they never tracked before thanks to new sensors, improvements in computing power, implementing cost and data storage.  ^TND0027

#### [0028](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=143.534,150.338)  
Data scientists are the people making sense of that information with a combination of statistics and computer programming.  ^TND0028

#### [0029](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=150.338,157.674)  
The profession's expanded rapidly in recent years and comes with an average salary of $130,000 a year.  ^TND0029

#### [0030](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=159.558,165.24)  
Much of the data Ivana works with comes from technology the NBA adopted in 2013.  ^TND0030

#### [0031](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=165.24,173.632)  
Every NBA arena has cameras that record the games and then from those cameras, they can extract player locations on a court.  ^TND0031

#### [0032](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=173.632,179.955)  
These cameras record 25 frames per second, so for each basketball game, there's a million of throes of data.  ^TND0032

#### [0033](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=179.955,184.635)  
And that allows Ivana to analyze plays that were previously difficult to track.  ^TND0033

#### [0034](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=184.635,186.976)  
For example, take the pick and roll.  ^TND0034

#### [0035](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=186.976,189.954)  
It's one of the most important plays in basketball.  ^TND0035

#### [0036](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=189.954,195.703)  
It involves one player setting up a human shield to help a teammate shake off an opponent.  ^TND0036

#### [0037](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=195.703,209.771)  
So we can look at each player, how much they run pick and rolls and how good they are at that and then we can select a player and see how often he's going to pass out of the pick and roll, how often he's going to shoot.  ^TND0037

#### [0038](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=209.771,213.619)  
And how would that help you develop a strategy for the coaches?  ^TND0038

#### [0039](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=213.619,217.951)  
So we could, for example this player, he's going to pass pretty frequently.  ^TND0039

#### [0040](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=217.951,223.926)  
We can say this to the coaches and they're going to decide on the defensive strategy for the player.  ^TND0040

#### [0041](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=223.926,231.375)  
But this makes Ivana's job look simpler than it actually is because she spends a lot of her time coding to extract the information she needs.  ^TND0041

#### [0042](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=231.375,235.515)  
And I tried really hard to get her to talk about what exactly she looks for.  ^TND0042

#### [0043](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=235.515,241.356)  
And there's some stuff that you do that's beyond just these interfaces that you showed me today, right?  ^TND0043

#### [0044](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=241.356,242.189)  
Yep.  ^TND0044

#### [0045](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=242.189,243.089)  
Can you tell me more about that?  ^TND0045

#### [0046](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=243.089,244.506)  
Um, not really.  ^TND0046

#### [0047](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=245.867,247.634)  
So that's like a trade secret?  ^TND0047

#### [0048](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=247.634,248.613)  
Yes.  ^TND0048

#### [0049](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=248.613,253.384)  
NBA's a very competitive league, so whatever can give us that advantage, we try to keep it.  ^TND0049

#### [0050](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=255.826,262.678)  
When advising the coaches with her analysis, Ivana has a decided advantage over many of her peers.  ^TND0050

#### [0051](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=262.678,267.324)  
I started playing when I was seven years old and I just loved it from the first day.  ^TND0051

#### [0052](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=267.324,271.34)  
I think 'cause the game is so dynamic and there's so many different skills.  ^TND0052

#### [0053](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=271.34,274.412)  
It's what I wanted to do since I was seven years old, really.  ^TND0053

#### [0054](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=274.412,276.291)  
I wanted to be a professional basketball player.  ^TND0054

#### [0055](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=276.291,277.54)  
Yeah.  ^TND0055

#### [0056](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=277.54,284.109)  
At 19, Ivana moved from her home in Croatia to New Jersey to go to college on a basketball scholarship.  ^TND0056

#### [0057](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=284.109,289.758)  
And while she was a star player on her Division I team, she was also an exceptional math student.  ^TND0057

#### [0058](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=289.758,294.585)  
Much of her life has been like that, balancing her love of basketball with her love of math.  ^TND0058

#### [0059](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=294.585,297.578)  
I always thought I'm going to have to choose between the two.  ^TND0059

#### [0060](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=297.578,305.004)  
I went to graduate school and that's when I really thought that, okay, I'm really choosing one or the other this time.  ^TND0060

#### [0061](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=306.969,309.304)  
So I thought I really chose just math.  ^TND0061

#### [0062](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=309.304,312.377)  
The plan was to become a researcher or a professor.  ^TND0062

#### [0063](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=312.377,325.217)  
Then, three years into pursuing her Ph.D. in math, she heard that NBA teams were starting to hire data scientists, but only 26% of data scientists are women and Ivana didn't like her odds.  ^TND0063

#### [0064](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=325.217,329.222)  
When I saw the job posting, I didn't think I would actually get the job.  ^TND0064

#### [0065](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=329.222,338.492)  
I thought because being a woman in such a male dominated field, they would never really consider me or give me a fair shot.  ^TND0065

#### [0066](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=338.492,340.607)  
But this prediction turned out to be wrong.  ^TND0066

#### [0067](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=340.607,344.837)  
She's got both the technical and basketball backgrounds, which is sort of the ideal mix.  ^TND0067

#### [0068](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=344.837,357.788)  
Her ability to capture these complex insights and then share them with players or coaches, with executives in a way that makes sense to us is super valuable and frankly, not that common.  ^TND0068

#### [0069](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=357.788,361.625)  
The next evening, I attended my very first NBA game.  ^TND0069

#### [0070](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=361.625,372.221)  
It was the last game of the regular season before the playoffs and my chance to catch up with the ultimate beneficiary of Ivana's work, the Sixers head coach, Brett Brown.  ^TND0070

#### [0071](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=372.221,374.606)  
The team has had a great season so far.  ^TND0071

#### [0072](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=374.606,378.387)  
What role do you think analytics has played in that success?  ^TND0072

#### [0073](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=378.387,382.809)  
I think it's played a significant role in our success and many, many others.  ^TND0073

#### [0074](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=382.809,393.302)  
The NBA playoffs are going to start in three or four days and immediately, we'll get an analytical assessment on the strengths or weaknesses of an opponent.  ^TND0074

#### [0075](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=393.302,397.826)  
You can assess play calls, good or bad ones, ones you should do more, ones you should avoid.  ^TND0075

#### [0076](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=397.826,406.872)  
Really, I think it's going to continue to grow and play a significant role in the design of organizations and coaching staff's beliefs.  ^TND0076

#### [0077](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=406.872,413.15)  
That night, even though none of the starting players played in the game, the Sixers ended up crushing the Bulls.  ^TND0077

#### [0078](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=413.15,421.296)  
A month later, the Sixers ended up advancing to the conference semi-finals and suffered a tough defeat at the hands of the Toronto Raptors.  ^TND0078

#### [0079](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=421.296,424.019)  
Is this the tie breaker?  ^TND0079

#### [0080](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=427.349,432.974)  
Ivana and her colleagues will keep looking for ways to help their team do better in the seasons ahead.  ^TND0080

#### [0081](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=432.974,438.228)  
But the Sixers victories on the court won't be the only way she's measuring her success.  ^TND0081

#### [0082](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=438.228,462.372)  
It's really exciting to be able to show young girls that they can actually have careers, but it also feels like a big responsibility because if I don't do well, it's going to seem like a woman cannot do this job, because there are not so many of us.  ^TND0082

#### [0083](https://youtu.be/MpLHMKTolVw#t=462.372,472.934)  
It's a big part of what motivates me every day to be able to show young girls that they can succeed in STEM fields and in sports.  ^TND0083
